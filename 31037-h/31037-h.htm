<h3>NOTE BY MR. LLOYD OSBOURNE</h3>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Stevenson</span> and I little knew, when we began our collaboration,
that we were afterwards to raise such a hornets&rsquo; nest
about our ears. The critics resented such an unequal
partnership, and made it impossible for us to continue it.
It may be that they were right; they wanted Stevenson&rsquo;s
best, and felt pretty sure they would not get it in our collaboration.
But when they ascribed all the good in our three
books to Stevenson and all the bad to me, they went a little
beyond the mark. It is a pleasure to me to recall that the
early part of both &ldquo;The Wrecker&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Ebb-Tide&rdquo;
was almost entirely my own; so also were the storm scenes
of the <i>Norah Creina</i>; so also the fight on the <i>Flying Scud</i>;
so also the inception of Huish&rsquo;s scheme, the revelation of
it to his companions, his landing on the atoll with the bottle
of vitriol in his breast. On the other hand, the Paris portion
of &ldquo;The Wrecker&rdquo; was all Stevenson&rsquo;s, as well as the concluding
chapters of both the South Sea books.</p>

<p>It is not possible to disentangle anything else that was
wholly mine or his&mdash;the blending was too complete, our
method of work too criss-crossed and intimate. For instance,
we would begin by outlining the story in a general
way; this done, we marshalled it into chapters, with a few
explanatory words to each; then it was for me to write the
first draft of Chapter I. This I would read to him, and if
satisfactory it was laid to one side; but were it not, I would
rewrite it, embodying his criticisms. Each chapter in turn
was fully discussed in advance before I put pen to paper;
and in this way, though the actual first draft was in my
own hand, the form of the story continually took shape
under Stevenson&rsquo;s eyes. When my first draft of the entire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>
book was finished he would rewrite it again from cover to
cover.</p>

<p>I can remember nothing more delightful than the days
we thus passed together. If our three books are in no wise
great, they preserve, it seems to me, something of the zest
and exhilaration that went into their making&mdash;the good
humour, the eagerness.</p>

<p>We were both under the glamour of the Islands&mdash;and
that life, so strange, so picturesque, so animated, took us
both by storm. Kings and beachcombers, pearl-fishers and
princesses, traders, slavers, and schooner-captains, castaways,
and runaways&mdash;what a world it was! And all this
in a fairyland of palms, and glassy bays, and little lost
settlements nestling at the foot of forest and mountain,
with kings to make brotherhood with us, and a dubious
white man or two, in earrings and pyjamas, no less insistent
to extend to us the courtesies of the &ldquo;beach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was amid such people, and amid such scenes, that
&ldquo;The Ebb-Tide&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Wrecker&rdquo; were written.</p>

<h2>THE EBB-TIDE</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>NIGHT ON THE BEACH</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Throughout</span> the island world of the Pacific, scattered
men of many European races, and from almost every grade
of society, carry activity and disseminate disease. Some
prosper, some vegetate. Some have mounted the steps of
thrones and owned islands and navies. Others again must
marry for a livelihood; a strapping, merry, chocolate-coloured
dame supports them in sheer idleness; and,
dressed like natives, but still retaining some foreign element
of gait or attitude, still perhaps with some relic (such as a
single eye-glass) of the officer and gentleman, they sprawl
in palm-leaf verandahs and entertain an island audience
with memoirs of the music-hall. And there are still others,
less pliable, less capable, less fortunate, perhaps less base,
who continue, even in these isles of plenty, to lack bread.</p>

<p>At the far end of the town of Papeete, three such men
were seated on the beach under a <i>purao</i>-tree.</p>

<p>It was late. Long ago the band had broken up
and marched musically home, a motley troop of men and
women, merchant clerks and navy officers, dancing in its
wake, arms about waist and crowned with garlands. Long
ago darkness and silence had gone from house to house
about the tiny pagan city. Only the street-lamps shone
on, making a glow-worm halo in the umbrageous alleys, or
drawing a tremulous image on the waters of the port. A
sound of snoring ran among the piles of lumber by the
Government pier. It was wafted ashore from the graceful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
clipper-bottomed schooners, where they lay moored close
in like dinghies, and their crews were stretched upon the
deck under the open sky or huddled in a rude tent amidst
the disorder of merchandise.</p>

<p>But the men under the <i>purao</i> had no thought of sleep.
The same temperature in England would have passed
without remark in summer; but it was bitter cold for the
South Seas. Inanimate nature knew it, and the bottle of
cocoa-nut oil stood frozen in every bird-cage house about
the island; and the men knew it, and shivered. They
wore flimsy cotton clothes, the same they had sweated in
by day and run the gauntlet of the tropic showers; and to
complete their evil case, they had no breakfast to mention,
less dinner, and no supper at all.</p>

<p>In the telling South Sea phrase, these three men were <i>on
the beach</i>. Common calamity had brought them acquainted,
as the three most miserable English-speaking creatures in
Tahiti; and beyond their misery, they knew next to nothing
of each other, not even their true names. For each had
made a long apprenticeship in going downward; and each,
at some stage of the descent, had been shamed into the
adoption of an <i>alias</i>. And yet not one of them had figured
in a court of justice; two were men of kindly virtues; and
one, as he sat and shivered under the <i>purao</i>, had a tattered
Virgil in his pocket.</p>

<p>Certainly, if money could have been raised upon the
book, Robert Herrick would long ago have sacrificed that
last possession; but the demand for literature, which is so
marked a feature in some parts of the South Seas, extends
not so far as the dead tongues; and the Virgil, which he
could not exchange against a meal, had often consoled him
in his hunger. He would study it, as he lay with tightened
belt on the floor of the old calaboose, seeking favourite
passages and finding new ones only less beautiful because
they lacked the consecration of remembrance. Or he
would pause on random country walks; sit on the path-side,
gazing over the sea on the mountains of Eimeo; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
dip into the <i>Aeneid</i>, seeking <i>sortes</i>. And if the oracle (as
is the way of oracles) replied with no very certain nor encouraging
voice, visions of England at least would throng
upon the exile&rsquo;s memory: the busy schoolroom, the green
playing-fields, holidays at home, and the perennial roar of
London, and the fireside, and the white head of his father.
For it is the destiny of those grave, restrained, and classic
writers, with whom we make enforced and often painful
acquaintanceship at school, to pass into the blood and
become native in the memory; so that a phrase of Virgil
speaks not so much of Mantua or Augustus, but of English
places and the student&rsquo;s own irrevocable youth.</p>

<p>Robert Herrick was the son of an intelligent, active,
and ambitious man, small partner in a considerable London
house. Hopes were conceived of the boy; he was sent to
a good school, gained there an Oxford scholarship, and proceeded
in course to the western University. With all his
talent and taste (and he had much of both) Robert was
deficient in consistency and intellectual manhood, wandered
in bypaths of study, worked at music or at metaphysics
when he should have been at Greek, and took at last a
paltry degree. Almost at the same time, the London
house was disastrously wound up; Mr. Herrick must begin
the world again as a clerk in a strange office, and Robert
relinquish his ambitions and accept with gratitude a career
that he detested and despised. He had no head for figures,
no interest in affairs, detested the constraint of hours, and
despised the aims and the success of merchants. To grow
rich was none of his ambitions; rather to do well. A worse
or a more bold young man would have refused the destiny;
perhaps tried his future with his pen; perhaps enlisted.
Robert, more prudent, possibly more timid, consented to
embrace that way of life in which he could most readily
assist his family. But he did so with a mind divided; fled the
neighbourhood of former comrades; and chose, out of several
positions placed at his disposal, a clerkship in New York.</p>

<p>His career thenceforth was one of unbroken shame.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span>
He did not drink, he was exactly honest, he was never rude
to his employers, yet was everywhere discharged. Bringing
no interest to his duties, he brought no attention; his day
was a tissue of things neglected and things done amiss; and
from place to place, and from town to town, he carried the
character of one thoroughly incompetent. No man can
bear the word applied to him without some flush of colour,
as indeed there is none other that so emphatically slams in
a man&rsquo;s face the door of self-respect. And to Herrick, who
was conscious of talents and acquirements, who looked
down upon those humble duties in which he was found
wanting, the pain was the more exquisite. Early in his
fall he had ceased to be able to make remittances; shortly
after, having nothing but failure to communicate, he ceased
writing home; and about a year before this tale begins,
turned suddenly upon the streets of San Francisco by a
vulgar and infuriated German Jew, he had broken the last
bonds of self-respect, and, upon a sudden impulse, changed
his name and invested his last dollar in a passage on the
mail brigantine, the <i>City of Papeete</i>. With what expectation
he had trimmed his flight for the South Seas, Herrick
perhaps scarcely knew. Doubtless there were fortunes to
be made in pearl and copra; doubtless others not more
gifted than himself had climbed in the island world to be
queen&rsquo;s consorts and king&rsquo;s ministers. But if Herrick had
gone there with any manful purpose, he would have kept
his father&rsquo;s name; the <i>alias</i> betrayed his moral bankruptcy;
he had struck his flag; he entertained no hope to reinstate
himself or help his straitened family; and he came to the
islands (where he knew the climate to be soft, bread cheap,
and manners easy) a skulker from life&rsquo;s battle and his own
immediate duty. Failure, he had said, was his portion;
let it be a pleasant failure.</p>

<p>It is fortunately not enough to say, &ldquo;I will be base.&rdquo;
Herrick continued in the islands his career of failure; but
in the new scene and under the new name, he suffered no
less sharply than before. A place was got, it was lost in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span>
old style; from the long-suffering of the keepers of restaurants
he fell to more open charity upon the wayside; as time
went on, good-nature became weary, and, after a repulse
or two, Herrick became shy. There were women enough
who would have supported a far worse and a far uglier man;
Herrick never met or never knew them: or if he did both,
some manlier feeling would revolt, and he preferred starvation.
Drenched with rains, broiling by day, shivering by
night, a disused and ruinous prison for a bedroom, his diet
begged or pilfered out of rubbish heaps, his associates two
creatures equally outcast with himself, he had drained for
months the cup of penitence. He had known what it was
to be resigned, what it was to break forth in a childish fury
of rebellion against fate, and what it was to sink into the
coma of despair. The time had changed him. He told
himself no longer tales of an easy and perhaps agreeable
declension; he read his nature otherwise; he had proved
himself incapable of rising, and he now learned by experience
that he could not stoop to fall. Something that was
scarcely pride or strength, that was perhaps only refinement,
withheld him from capitulation; but he looked on
upon his own misfortune with a growing rage, and sometimes
wondered at his patience.</p>

<p>It was now the fourth month completed, and still there
was no change or sign of change. The moon, racing through
a world of flying clouds of every size and shape and density,
some black as inkstains, some delicate as lawn, threw the
marvel of her southern brightness over the same lovely and
detested scene: the island mountains crowned with the
perennial island cloud, the embowered city studded with
rare lamps, the masts in the harbour, the smooth mirror of
the lagoon, and the mole of the barrier reef on which the
breakers whitened. The moon shone too, with bull&rsquo;s-eye
sweeps, on his companions; on the stalwart frame of the
American who called himself Brown, and was known to be
a master-mariner in some disgrace; and on the dwarfish
person, the pale eyes and toothless smile of a vulgar and bad-hearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>12</span>
cockney clerk. Here was society for Robert
Herrick! The Yankee skipper was a man at least: he had
sterling qualities of tenderness and resolution: he was one
whose hand you could take without a blush. But there was
no redeeming grace about the other, who called himself
sometimes Hay and sometimes Tomkins, and laughed at
the discrepancy; who had been employed in every store in
Papeete, for the creature was able in his way; who had been
discharged from each in turn, for he was wholly vile; who
had alienated all his old employers so that they passed him
in the street as if he were a dog, and all his old comrades so
that they shunned him as they would a creditor.</p>

<p>Not long before, a ship from Peru had brought an
influenza, and it now raged in the island, and particularly
in Papeete. From all round the <i>purao</i> arose and fell a
dismal sound of men coughing, and strangling as they
coughed. The sick natives, with the islander&rsquo;s impatience
of a touch of fever, had crawled from their houses to be
cool, and, squatting on the shore or on the beached canoes,
painfully expected the new day. Even as the crowing of
cocks goes about the country in the night from farm to
farm, accesses of coughing arose and spread, and died in
the distance, and sprang up again. Each miserable shiverer
caught the suggestion from his neighbour, was torn for some
minutes by that cruel ecstasy, and left spent and without
voice or courage when it passed. If a man had pity to
spend, Papeete beach, in that cold night and in that infected
season, was a place to spend it on. And of all the sufferers
perhaps the least deserving, but surely the most pitiable,
was the London clerk. He was used to another life, to
houses, beds, nursing, and the dainties of the sick-room;
he lay here now, in the cold open, exposed to the gusting
of the wind, and with an empty belly. He was besides
infirm; the disease shook him to the vitals; and his companions
watched his endurance with surprise. A profound
commiseration filled them, and contended with and conquered
their abhorrence. The disgust attendant on so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
ugly a sickness magnified this dislike; at the same time,
and with more than compensating strength, shame for a
sentiment so inhuman bound them the more straitly to his
service; and even the evil they knew of him swelled their
solicitude, for the thought of death is always the least supportable
when it draws near to the merely sensual and
selfish. Sometimes they held him up; sometimes, with
mistaken helpfulness, they beat him between the shoulders;
and when the poor wretch lay back ghastly and spent after
a paroxysm of coughing, they would sometimes peer into
his face, doubtfully exploring it for any mark of life. There
is no one but has some virtue: that of the clerk was courage;
and he would make haste to reassure them in a pleasantry
not always decent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, pals,&rdquo; he gasped once: &ldquo;this is the thing
to strengthen the muscles of the larynx.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you take the cake!&rdquo; cried the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I&rsquo;m good plucked enough,&rdquo; pursued the sufferer
with a broken utterance. &ldquo;But it do seem bloomin&rsquo; hard
to me, that I should be the only party down with this form
of vice, and the only one to do the funny business. I
think one of you other parties might wake up. Tell a
fellow something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trouble is we&rsquo;ve nothing to tell, my son,&rdquo; returned
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, if you like, what I was thinking,&rdquo; said
Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us anything,&rdquo; said the clerk, &ldquo;I only want to be
reminded that I ain&rsquo;t dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick took up his parable, lying on his face and speaking
slowly and scarce above his breath, not like a man who
has anything to say, but like one talking against time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was thinking this,&rdquo; he began: &ldquo;I was thinking
I lay on Papeete beach one night&mdash;all moon and squalls and
fellows coughing&mdash;and I was cold and hungry, and down in
the mouth, and was about ninety years of age, and had
spent two hundred and twenty of them on Papeete beach.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
And I was thinking I wished I had a ring to rub, or had a
fairy godmother, or could raise Beelzebub. And I was
trying to remember how you did it. I knew you made a
ring of skulls, for I had seen that in the <i>Freischütz</i>: and that
you took off your coat and turned up your sleeves, for I
had seen Formes do that when he was playing Kaspar, and
you could see (by the way he went about it) it was a business
he had studied; and that you ought to have something to
kick up a smoke and a bad smell, I daresay a cigar might
do, and that you ought to say the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer backwards.
Well, I wondered if I could do that; it seemed rather a
feat, you see. And then I wondered if I would say it
forward, and I thought I did. Well, no sooner had I got
to <i>world without end</i>, than I saw a man in a <i>pariu</i>, and with
a mat under his arm, come along the beach from the town.
He was rather a hard-favoured old party, and he limped
and crippled, and all the time he kept coughing. At first
I didn&rsquo;t cotton to his looks, I thought, and then I got sorry
for the old soul because he coughed so hard. I remembered
that we had some of that cough mixture the American consul
gave the captain for Hay. It never did Hay a ha&rsquo;porth
of service, but I thought it might do the old gentleman&rsquo;s
business for him, and stood up. &lsquo;<i>Yorana!</i>&rsquo; says I.
&lsquo;<i>Yorana!</i>&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got some
first-rate stuff in a bottle; it&rsquo;ll fix your cough, savvy?
<i>Harry my</i><a name="FnAnchor_1" id="FnAnchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and I&rsquo;ll measure you a tablespoonful in the palm
of my hand, for all our plate is at the bankers.&rsquo; So I
thought the old party came up, and the nearer he came the
less I took to him. But I had passed my word, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot is this bloomin&rsquo; drivel?&rdquo; interrupted the clerk.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the rot there is in tracts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a story; I used to tell them to the kids at home,&rdquo;
said Herrick. &ldquo;If it bores you, I&rsquo;ll drop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, cut along!&rdquo; returned the sick man irritably. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
better than nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Herrick, &ldquo;I had no sooner given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
him the cough mixture than he seemed to straighten up and
change, and I saw he wasn&rsquo;t a Tahitian after all, but some
kind of Arab, and had a long beard on his chin. &lsquo;One good
turn deserves another,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I am a magician out of
the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; and this mat that I have under my
arm is the original carpet of Mohammed Ben Somebody-or-other.
Say the word, and you can have a cruise upon the
carpet.&rsquo; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say this is the Travelling
Carpet?&rsquo; I cried. &lsquo;You bet I do,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been
to America since last I read the &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo;&rsquo; said
I, a little suspicious. &lsquo;I should think so,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Been
everywhere. A man with a carpet like this isn&rsquo;t going to
moulder in a semi-detached villa.&rsquo; Well, that struck me
as reasonable. &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;and do you mean to
tell me I can get on that carpet and go straight to London,
England?&rsquo; I said &lsquo;London, England,&rsquo; captain, because he
seemed to have been so long in your part of the world. &lsquo;In
the crack of a whip,&rsquo; said he. I figured up the time. What
is the difference between Papeete and London, captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Taking Greenwich and Point Venus, nine hours, odd
minutes and seconds,&rdquo; replied the mariner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s about what I made it,&rdquo; resumed Herrick,
&ldquo;about nine hours. Calling this three in the morning, I
made out I would drop into London about noon; and the
idea tickled me immensely. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s only one bother,&rsquo; I
said, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t a copper cent. It would be a pity to go
to London and not buy the morning <i>Standard</i>.&rsquo; &lsquo;O!&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t realise the conveniences of this carpet. You
see this pocket? you&rsquo;ve only got to stick your hand in, and
you pull it out filled with sovereigns.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Double-eagles, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; inquired the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was what it was!&rdquo; cried Herrick. &ldquo;I thought
they seemed unusually big, and I remember now I had to
go to the money-changers at Charing Cross and get English
silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you went there?&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;Wot did you
do? Bet you had a B.-and-S.!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, it was just as the old boy said&mdash;like
the cut of a whip,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;The one minute I was
here on the beach at three in the morning, the next I
was in front of the Golden Cross at midday. At first I was
dazzled, and covered my eyes, and there didn&rsquo;t seem the
smallest change; the roar of the Strand and the roar of the
reef were like the same: hark to it now, and you can hear
the cabs and &lsquo;buses rolling and the streets resound! And
then at last I could look about, and there was the old place,
and no mistake! With the statues in the square, and St.
Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields, and the bobbies, and the sparrows,
and the hacks; and I can&rsquo;t tell you what I felt like. I felt
like crying, I believe, or dancing, or jumping clean over the
Nelson Column. I was like a fellow caught up out of Hell
and flung down into the dandiest part of Heaven. Then I
spotted for a hansom with a spanking horse. &lsquo;A shilling
for yourself if you&rsquo;re there in twenty minutes!&rsquo; said I to
the jarvey. He went a good pace, though of course it was
a trifle to the carpet; and in nineteen minutes and a half I
was at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What door?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, a house I know of,&rdquo; returned Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet it was a public-house!&rdquo; cried the clerk,&mdash;only
these were not his words. &ldquo;And w&rsquo;y didn&rsquo;t you take the
carpet there instead of trundling in a growler?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to startle a quiet street,&rdquo; said the
narrator. &ldquo;Bad form. And besides, it was a hansom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and what did you do next?&rdquo; inquired the
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I went in,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old folks?&rdquo; asked the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; said the other, chewing a grass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think you are about the poorest &lsquo;and at a
yarn!&rdquo; cried the clerk. &ldquo;Crikey, it&rsquo;s like &lsquo;Ministering
Children!&rsquo; I can tell you there would be more beer and
skittles about my little jaunt. I would go and have a
B.-and-S. for luck. Then I would get a big ulster with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
astrakhan fur, and take my cane and do the la-de-da down
Piccadilly. Then I would go to a slap-up restaurant, and
have green peas, and a bottle of fizz, and a chump chop&mdash;O!
and I forgot, I&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave some devilled whitebait first&mdash;and
green gooseberry tart, and &rsquo;ot coffee, and some of that
form of vice in big bottles with a seal&mdash;Benedictine&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the bloomin&rsquo; nyme! Then I&rsquo;d drop into a theatre, and pal
on with some chappies, and do the dancing rooms and bars,
and that, and wouldn&rsquo;t go &rsquo;ome till morning, till daylight
doth appear. And the next day I&rsquo;d have water-cresses,
&rsquo;am, muffin, and fresh butter; wouldn&rsquo;t I just, O my!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clerk was interrupted by a fresh attack of coughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I would do,&rdquo; said the
captain: &ldquo;I would have none of your fancy rigs with the man
driving from the mizzen cross-trees, but a plain fore-and-aft
hack cab of the highest registered tonnage. First of
all, I would bring up at the market and get a turkey and
a sucking-pig. Then I&rsquo;d go to a wine-merchant&rsquo;s and get
a dozen of champagne, and a dozen of some sweet wine,
rich and sticky and strong, something in the port or madeira
line, the best in the store. Then I&rsquo;d bear up for a toy-store,
and lay out twenty dollars in assorted toys for the pickaninnies;
and then to a confectioner&rsquo;s and take in cakes
and pies and fancy bread, and that stuff with the plums in
it; and then to a newsagency and buy all the papers,
all the picture ones for the kids, and all the story papers
for the old girl about the Earl discovering himself to
Anna-Mariar and the escape of the Lady Maude from the
private madhouse; and then I&rsquo;d tell the fellow to drive
home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There ought to be some syrup for the kids,&rdquo; suggested
Herrick; &ldquo;they like syrup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, syrup for the kids, red syrup at that!&rdquo; said the
captain. &ldquo;And those things they pull at, and go pop, and
have measly poetry inside. And then I tell you we&rsquo;d have
a thanksgiving-day and Christmas-tree combined. Great
Scott, but I would like to see the kids! I guess they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
light right out of the house when they saw daddy driving
up. My little Adar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain stopped sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, keep it up!&rdquo; said the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The damned thing is, I don&rsquo;t know if they ain&rsquo;t
starving!&rdquo; cried the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t be worse off than we are, and that&rsquo;s one
comfort,&rdquo; returned the clerk. &ldquo;I defy the devil to make
me worse off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It seemed as if the devil heard him. The light of the
moon had been some time cut off and they had talked in
darkness. Now there was heard a roar, which drew impetuously
nearer; the face of the lagoon was seen to whiten;
and before they had staggered to their feet, a squall burst
in rain upon the outcasts. The rage and volume of that
avalanche one must have lived in the tropics to conceive; a
man panted in its assault as he might pant under a shower-bath;
and the world seemed whelmed in night and water.</p>

<p>They fled, groping for their usual shelter&mdash;it might be
almost called their home&mdash;in the old calaboose; came
drenched into its empty chambers; and lay down, three
sops of humanity, on the cold coral floors, and presently,
when the squall was overpast, the others could hear in the
darkness the chattering of the clerk&rsquo;s teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, you fellows,&rdquo; he wailed, &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake, lie
up and try to warm me. I&rsquo;m blymed if I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll
die else!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the three crept together into one wet mass, and lay
until day came, shivering and dozing off, and continually
re-awakened to wretchedness by the coughing of the clerk.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>MORNING ON THE BEACH&mdash;THE THREE LETTERS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> clouds were all fled, the beauty of the tropic day was
spread upon Papeete; and the wall of breaking seas upon
the reef, and the palms upon the islet, already trembled
in the heat. A French man-of-war was going out, homeward
bound; she lay in the middle distance of the port, an
ant-heap for activity. In the night a schooner had come
in, and now lay far out, hard by the passage; and the
yellow flag, the emblem of pestilence, flew on her. From
up the coast, a long procession of canoes headed round the
point and towards the market, bright as a scarf with the
many-coloured clothing of the natives and the piles of fruit.
But not even the beauty and the welcome warmth of the
morning, not even these naval movements, so interesting
to sailors and to idlers, could engage the attention of the
outcasts. They were still cold at heart, their mouths sour
from the want of sleep, their steps rambling from the lack
of food; and they strung like lame geese along the beach
in a disheartened silence. It was towards the town they
moved; towards the town whence smoke arose, where
happier folk were breakfasting; and as they went, their
hungry eyes were upon all sides, but they were only scouting
for a meal.</p>

<p>A small and dingy schooner lay snug against the quay,
with which it was connected by a plank. On the forward
deck, under a spot of awning, five Kanakas, who made up
the crew, were squatted round a basin of fried feis,<a name="FnAnchor_2" id="FnAnchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and
drinking coffee from tin mugs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight bells: knock off for breakfast!&rdquo; cried the
captain, with a miserable heartiness. &ldquo;Never tried this
craft before; positively my first appearance; guess I&rsquo;ll
draw a bumper house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came close up to where the plank rested on the
grassy quay; turned his back upon the schooner, and began
to whistle that lively air, &ldquo;The Irish Washerwoman.&rdquo; It
caught the ears of the Kanaka seamen like a preconcerted
signal; with one accord they looked up from their meal
and crowded to the ship&rsquo;s side, fei in hand and munching
as they looked. Even as a poor brown Pyrenean bear
dances in the streets of English towns under his master&rsquo;s
baton; even so, but with how much more of spirit and precision,
the captain footed it in time to his own whistling,
and his long morning shadow capered beyond him on the
grass. The Kanakas smiled on the performance; Herrick
looked on heavy-eyed, hunger for the moment conquering
all sense of shame; and a little farther off, but still hard
by, the clerk was torn by the seven devils of the influenza.</p>

<p>The captain stopped suddenly, appeared to perceive
his audience for the first time, and represented the part of
a man surprised in his private hour of pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>The Kanakas clapped hands and called upon him to
go on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <i>sir</i>!&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;No eat, no dance.
Savvy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor old man!&rdquo; returned one of the crew. &ldquo;Him
no eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, no!&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Like-um too much
eat. No got.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Me got,&rdquo; said the sailor; &ldquo;you tome here.
Plenty toffee, plenty fei. Nutha man him tome too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll drop right in,&rdquo; observed the captain;
and he and his companions hastened up the plank. They
were welcomed on board with the shaking of hands; place
was made for them round the basin; a sticky demijohn of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
molasses was added to the feast in honour of company,
and an accordion brought from the forecastle and significantly
laid by the performer&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ariana</i>,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_3" id="FnAnchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a> said he lightly, touching the instrument
as he spoke; and he fell to on a long savoury fei, made an
end of it, raised his mug of coffee, and nodded across at the
spokesman of the crew. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your health, old man;
you&rsquo;re a credit to the South Pacific,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>With the unsightly greed of hounds they glutted themselves
with the hot food and coffee; and even the clerk
revived and the colour deepened in his eyes. The kettle
was drained, the basin cleaned; their entertainers, who
had waited on their wants throughout with the pleased
hospitality of Polynesians, made haste to bring forward
a dessert of island tobacco and rolls of pandanus leaf to
serve as paper; and presently all sat about the dishes puffing
like Indian sachems.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When a man &rsquo;as breakfast every day, he don&rsquo;t know
what it is,&rdquo; observed the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next point is dinner,&rdquo; said Herrick; and then
with a passionate utterance: &ldquo;I wish to God I was a
Kanaka!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing sure,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m about
desperate; I&rsquo;d rather hang than rot here much longer.&rdquo;
And with the word he took the accordion and struck up
&ldquo;Home, sweet Home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, drop that!&rdquo; cried Herrick, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more can I,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to play
something though: got to pay the shot, my son.&rdquo; And
he struck up &ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s Body&rdquo; in a fine sweet baritone:
&ldquo;Dandy Jim of Carolina&rdquo; came next; &ldquo;Rorin the Bold,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Swing low, Sweet Chariot,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Beautiful Land&rdquo;
followed. The captain was paying his shot with usury,
as he had done many a time before; many a meal had he
bought with the same currency from the melodious-minded
natives, always, as now, to their delight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span></p>

<p>He was in the middle of &ldquo;Fifteen Dollars in the Inside
Pocket,&rdquo; singing with dogged energy, for the task went
sore against the grain, when a sensation was suddenly to
be observed among the crew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Tapena Tom harry my</i>,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_4" id="FnAnchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> said the spokesman,
pointing.</p>

<p>And the three beachcombers, following his indication,
saw the figure of a man in pyjama trousers and a white
jumper approaching briskly from the town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Tapena Tom, is it?&rdquo; said the captain, pausing
in his music. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to place the brute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better cut,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the musician deliberately, &ldquo;one can&rsquo;t
most generally always tell. I&rsquo;ll try it on, I guess. Music
has charms to soothe the savage Tapena, boys. We might
strike it rich; it might amount to iced punch in the cabin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hiced punch? O my!&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;Give him
something &rsquo;ot, captain. &lsquo;Way down the Swannee River&rsquo;:
try that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <i>sir</i>! Looks Scots,&rdquo; said the captain; and he
struck, for his life, into &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Tom continued to approach with the same
business-like alacrity; no change was to be perceived in
his bearded face as he came swinging up the plank: he did
not even turn his eyes on the performer.</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;We twa hae paidled in the burn,</p>
<p class="i05">Frae morning tide till dine,&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">went the song.</p>

<p>Captain Tom had a parcel under his arm, which he laid
on the house roof, and then turning suddenly to the
strangers: &ldquo;Here, you!&rdquo; he bellowed, &ldquo;be off out of
that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clerk and Herrick stood not on the order of their
going, but fled incontinently by the plank. The performer,
on the other hand, flung down the instrument and rose to
his full height slowly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve half a mind
to give you a lesson in civility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You set up any more of your gab to me,&rdquo; returned
the Scotsman, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll show ye the wrong side of a jyle.
I&rsquo;ve heard tell of the three of ye. Ye&rsquo;re not long for here,
I can tell ye that. The Government has their eyes upon
ye. They make short work of damned beachcombers, I&rsquo;ll
say that for the French.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wait till I catch you off your ship!&rdquo; cried the
captain; and then, turning to the crew, &ldquo;Good-bye, you
fellows!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re gentlemen, anyway! The
worst nigger among you would look better upon a quarter-deck
than that filthy Scotsman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Tom scorned to reply. He watched with a
hard smile the departure of his guests, and as soon as the
last foot was off the plank, turned to the hands to work
cargo.</p>

<p>The beachcombers beat their inglorious retreat along
the shore; Herrick first, his face dark with blood, his knees
trembling under him with the hysteria of rage. Presently,
under the same <i>purao</i> where they had shivered the night
before, he cast himself down, and groaned aloud, and ground
his face into the sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me, don&rsquo;t speak to me. I can&rsquo;t stand
it,&rdquo; broke from him.</p>

<p>The other two stood over him perplexed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot can&rsquo;t he stand now?&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;&rsquo;Asn&rsquo;t
he &rsquo;ad a meal? <i>I&rsquo;m</i> lickin&rsquo; my lips.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick reared up his wild eyes and burning face.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t beg!&rdquo; he screamed, and again threw himself
prone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This thing&rsquo;s got to come to an end,&rdquo; said the captain,
with an intake of the breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looks like signs of an end, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; sneered the
clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not so far from it, and don&rsquo;t you deceive yourself,&rdquo;
replied the captain.&mdash;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he added in a livelier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
voice, &ldquo;you fellows hang on here, and I&rsquo;ll go and interview
my representative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon he turned on his heel, and set off at a swinging
sailor&rsquo;s walk towards Papeete.</p>

<p>It was some half-hour later when he returned. The
clerk was dozing with his back against the tree: Herrick
still lay where he had flung himself; nothing showed whether
he slept or waked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, boys!&rdquo; cried the captain, with that artificial
heartiness of his which was at times so painful, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
a new idea.&rdquo; And he produced note-paper, stamped
envelopes, and pencils, three of each. &ldquo;We can all write
home by the mail brigantine; the consul says I can come
over to his place and ink up the addresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a start, too,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;I never
thought of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was that yarning last night about going home that
put me up to it,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;and over,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave a shy,&rdquo;
and he retired a little distance to the shade of a canoe.</p>

<p>The others remained under the <i>purao</i>. Now they
would write a word or two, now scribble it out; now they
would sit biting at the pencil end and staring seaward;
now their eyes would rest on the clerk, where he sat propped
on the canoe, leering and coughing, his pencil racing glibly
on the paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Herrick suddenly. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
got the heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said the captain, speaking with unwonted
gravity; &ldquo;it may be hard to write, and to write lies at
that; and God knows it is; but it&rsquo;s the square thing. It
don&rsquo;t cost anything to say you&rsquo;re well and happy, and sorry
you can&rsquo;t make a remittance this mail; and if you don&rsquo;t
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think it is&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s about the high-water
mark of being a brute beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to talk,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem
to have written much yourself, I notice.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you bring in me for?&rdquo; broke from the captain.
His voice was indeed scarce raised above a whisper,
but emotion clanged in it. &ldquo;What do you know about me?
If you had commanded the finest barque that ever sailed
from Portland; if you had been drunk in your berth when
she struck the breakers in Fourteen Island Group, and
hadn&rsquo;t had the wit to stay there and drown, but came on
deck, and given drunken orders, and lost six lives&mdash;I could
understand your talking then! There,&rdquo; he said more
quietly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my yarn, and now you know it. It&rsquo;s
a pretty one for the father of a family. Five men and a
woman murdered. Yes, there was a woman on board, and
hadn&rsquo;t no business to be either. Guess I sent her to Hell,
if there is such a place. I never dared go home again; and
the wife and the little ones went to England to her father&rsquo;s
place. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come to them,&rdquo; he added, with
a bitter shrug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, captain,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I never liked
you better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They shook hands, short and hard, with eyes averted,
tenderness swelling in their bosoms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, boys! to work again at lying!&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give my father up,&rdquo; returned Herrick with
a writhen smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try my sweetheart instead for a
change of evils.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And here is what he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;Emma, I have scratched out the beginning to my father, for I
think I can write more easily to you. This is my last farewell to all,
the last you will ever hear or see of an unworthy friend and son.
I have failed in life; I am quite broken down and disgraced. I pass
under a false name; you will have to tell my father that with all
your kindness. It is my own fault. I know, had I chosen, that
I might have done well; and yet I swear to you I tried to choose. I
could not bear that you should think I did not try. For I loved you
all; you must never doubt me in that, you least of all. I have
always unceasingly loved, but what was my love worth? and what
was I worth? I had not the manhood of a common clerk; I could
not work to earn you; I have lost you now, and for your sake I could
be glad of it. When you first came to my father&rsquo;s house&mdash;do you
remember those days? I want you to&mdash;you saw the best of me then,
all that was good in me. Do you remember the day I took your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
hand and would not let it go&mdash;and the day on Battersea Bridge,
when we were looking at a barge, and I began to tell you one of my
silly stories, and broke off to say I loved you? That was the beginning,
and now here is the end. When you have read this letter,
you will go round and kiss them all good-bye, my father and mother,
and the children, one by one, and poor uncle; and tell them all to
forget me, and forget me yourself. Turn the key in the door; let
no thought of me return; be done with the poor ghost that pretended
he was a man and stole your love. Scorn of myself grinds in me as
I write. I should tell you I am well and happy, and want for
nothing. I do not exactly make money, or I should send a remittance;
but I am well cared for, have friends, live in a beautiful
place and climate, such as we have dreamed of together, and no pity
need be wasted on me. In such places, you understand, it is easy to
live, and live well, but often hard to make sixpence in money.
Explain this to my father, he will understand. I have no more to
say; only linger, going out, like an unwilling guest. God in heaven
bless you. Think of me at the last, here, on a bright beach, the sky
and sea immoderately blue, and the great breakers roaring outside
on a barrier reef, where a little isle sits green with palms. I am well
and strong. It is a more pleasant way to die than if you were crowding
about me on a sick-bed. And yet I am dying. This is my last
kiss. Forgive, forget the unworthy.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>So far he had written, his paper was all filled, when there
returned a memory of evenings at the piano, and that song,
the masterpiece of love, in which so many have found the
expression of their dearest thoughts. &ldquo;<i>Einst, O Wunder!</i>&rdquo;
he added. More was not required; he knew that in his
love&rsquo;s heart the context would spring up, escorted with
fair images and harmony; of how all through life her name
should tremble in his ears, her name be everywhere repeated
in the sounds of nature; and when death came, and he lay
dissolved, her memory lingered and thrilled among his
elements.</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Once, O wonder! once from the ashes of my heart</p>
<p class="i05">Arose a blossom&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Herrick and the captain finished their letters about the
same time; each was breathing deep, and their eyes met
and were averted as they closed the envelopes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry I write so big,&rdquo; said the captain gruffly. &ldquo;Came
all of a rush, when it did come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I could have done with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
a ream when I got started; but it&rsquo;s long enough for all the
good I had to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were still at the addresses when the clerk strolled
up, smirking and twirling his envelope, like a man well
pleased. He looked over Herrick&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t writing &rsquo;ome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, though,&rdquo; said Herrick; &ldquo;she lives with my
father.&mdash;O, I see what you mean,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;My real
name is Herrick. No more Hay&rdquo;&mdash;they had both used
the same <i>alias</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;no more Hay than yours, I daresay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clean bowled in the middle stump!&rdquo; laughed the
clerk. &ldquo;My name&rsquo;s &rsquo;Uish, if you want to know. Everybody
has a false nyme in the Pacific. Lay you five to three
the captain &rsquo;as.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I have too,&rdquo; replied the captain; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve never
told my own since the day I tore the title-page out of my
Bowditch and flung the damned thing into the sea. But
I&rsquo;ll tell it to you, boys. John Davis is my name. I&rsquo;m
Davis of the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dooce you are!&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;And what was she?
a pirate or a slyver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was the fastest barque out of Portland, Maine,&rdquo;
replied the captain; &ldquo;and for the way I lost her, I might
as well have bored a hole in her side with an auger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you lost her, did you?&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ope
she was insured?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No answer being returned to this sally, Huish, still
brimming over with vanity and conversation, struck into
another subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to read you my letter,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good fist with a pen when I choose, and this is a
prime lark. She was a barmaid I ran across in Northampton;
she was a spanking fine piece, no end of style;
and we cottoned at first sight like parties in the play. I
suppose I spent the chynge of a fiver on that girl. Well,
I &rsquo;appened to remember her nyme, so I wrote to her, and
told her &rsquo;ow I had got rich, and married a queen in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>
Hislands, and lived in a blooming palace. Such a sight of
crammers! I must read you one bit about my opening
the nigger parliament in a cocked &rsquo;at. It&rsquo;s really prime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain jumped to his feet. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you
did with the paper that I went and begged for you?&rdquo; he
roared.</p>

<p>It was perhaps lucky for Huish&mdash;it was surely in the
end unfortunate for all&mdash;that he was seized just then by
one of his prostrating accesses of cough; his comrades would
have else deserted him, so bitter was their resentment.
When the fit had passed, the clerk reached out his hand,
picked up the letter, which had fallen to the earth, and tore
it into fragments, stamp and all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does that satisfy you?&rdquo; he asked sullenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll say no more about it,&rdquo; replied Davis.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>THE OLD CALABOOSE&mdash;DESTINY AT THE DOOR</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> old calaboose, in which the waifs had so long harboured,
is a low, rectangular enclosure of building at
the corner of a shady western avenue and a little townward
of the British consulate. Within was a grassy court,
littered with wreckage and the traces of vagrant occupation.
Six or seven cells opened from the court: the
doors, that had once been locked on mutinous whalermen,
rotting before them in the grass. No mark remained
of their old destination, except the rusty bars upon the
windows.</p>

<p>The floor of one of the cells had been a little cleared;
a bucket (the last remaining piece of furniture of the three
caitiffs) stood full of water by the door, a half cocoa-nut
shell beside it for a drinking-cup; and on some ragged ends
of mat Huish sprawled asleep, his mouth open, his face
deathly. The glow of the tropic afternoon, the green of
sunbright foliage, stared into that shady place through
door and window; and Herrick, pacing to and fro on the
coral floor, sometimes paused and laved his face and neck
with tepid water from the bucket. His long arrears of
suffering, the night&rsquo;s vigil, the insults of the morning, and
the harrowing business of the letter, had strung him to that
point when pain is almost pleasure, time shrinks to a mere
point, and death and life appear indifferent. To and fro
he paced like a caged brute; his mind whirling through the
universe of thought and memory; his eyes, as he went,
skimming the legends on the wall. The crumbling whitewash
was all full of them: Tahitian names, and French, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
English, and rude sketches of ships under sail and men at
fisticuffs.</p>

<p>It came to him of a sudden that he too must leave upon
these walls the memorial of his passage. He paused before
a clean space, took the pencil out, and pondered. Vanity,
so hard to dislodge, awoke in him. We call it vanity at
least; perhaps unjustly. Rather it was the bare sense of
his existence prompted him; the sense of his life, the one
thing wonderful, to which he scarce clung with a finger.
From his jarred nerves there came a strong sentiment of
coming change; whether good or ill he could not say:
change, he knew no more&mdash;change with inscrutable veiled
face, approaching noiseless. With the feeling came the
vision of a concert-room, the rich hues of instruments, the
silent audience, and the loud voice of the symphony.
&ldquo;Destiny knocking at the door,&rdquo; he thought; drew a stave
on the plaster, and wrote in the famous phrase from the
Fifth Symphony. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;they will know
that I loved music and had classical tastes. They? He,
I suppose: the unknown, kindred spirit that shall come
some day and read my <i>memor querela</i>. Ha, he shall have
Latin too!&rdquo; And he added: <i>terque quaterque beati Queis
ante ora patrum</i>.</p>

<p>He turned again to his uneasy pacing, but now with
an irrational and supporting sense of duty done. He had
dug his grave that morning; now he had carved his epitaph;
the folds of the toga were composed, why should he
delay the insignificant trifle that remained to do? He
paused and looked long in the face of the sleeping Huish,
drinking disenchantment and distaste of life. He nauseated
himself with that vile countenance. Could the thing continue?
What bound him now? Had he no rights?&mdash;only
the obligation to go on, without discharge or furlough,
bearing the unbearable? <i>Ich trage unerträgliches</i>, the quotation
rose in his mind; he repeated the whole piece, one of
the most perfect of the most perfect of poets; and a phrase
struck him like a blow: <i>Du, stolzes Herz, du hast es ja gewollt.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span>
Where was the pride of his heart? And he raged against
himself, as a man bites on a sore tooth, in a heady sensuality
of scorn. &ldquo;I have no pride, I have no heart, no manhood,&rdquo;
he thought, &ldquo;or why should I prolong a life more shameful
than the gallows? Or why should I have fallen to it? No
pride, no capacity, no force. Not even a bandit! and to be
starving here with worse than banditti&mdash;with this trivial
hell-hound!&rdquo; His rage against his comrade rose and
flooded him, and he shook a trembling fist at the sleeper.</p>

<p>A swift step was audible. The captain appeared upon
the threshold of the cell, panting and flushed, and with a
foolish face of happiness. In his arms he carried a loaf of
bread and bottles of beer; the pockets of his coat were
bulging with cigars. He rolled his treasures on the floor,
grasped Herrick by both hands, and crowed with laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Broach the beer!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Broach the beer,
and glory hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beer?&rdquo; repeated Huish, struggling to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beer it is!&rdquo; cried Davis. &ldquo;Beer, and plenty of it.
Any number of persons can use it (like Lyon&rsquo;s tooth-tablet)
with perfect propriety and neatness.&mdash;Who&rsquo;s to officiate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone for that,&rdquo; said the clerk. He knocked
the necks off with a lump of coral, and each drank in succession
from the shell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a weed,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in the bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is up?&rdquo; asked Herrick.</p>

<p>The captain fell suddenly grave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to
that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I want to speak with Herrick here.
You, Hay&mdash;or Huish, or whatever your name is&mdash;you take
a weed and the other bottle, and go and see how the wind
is down by the <i>purao</i>. I&rsquo;ll call you when you&rsquo;re wanted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey? Secrets? That ain&rsquo;t the ticket,&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, my son,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;this is business,
and don&rsquo;t you make any mistake about it. If you&rsquo;re
going to make trouble, you can have it your own way and
stop right here. Only get the thing right: if Herrick and
I go, we take the beer. Savvy?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t want to shove my oar in,&rdquo; returned Huish.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cut right enough. Give me the swipes. You can
jaw till you&rsquo;re blue in the face for what I care. I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s the friendly touch, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; And he shambled
grumbling out of the cell into the staring sun.</p>

<p>The captain watched him clear of the courtyard; then
turned to Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Herrick thickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;I want to consult you.
It&rsquo;s a chance we&rsquo;ve got.&mdash;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried, pointing
to the music on the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;O, that! It&rsquo;s music;
it&rsquo;s a phrase of Beethoven&rsquo;s I was writing up. It means
Destiny knocking at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does it?&rdquo; said the captain, rather low; and he went
near and studied the inscription. &ldquo;And this French?&rdquo;
he asked, pointing to the Latin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it just means I should have been luckier if I had
died at home,&rdquo; returned Herrick impatiently. &ldquo;What is
this business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Destiny knocking at the door,&rdquo; repeated the captain;
and then, looking over his shoulder, &ldquo;Well, Mr. Herrick,
that&rsquo;s about what it comes to,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Explain yourself,&rdquo; said
Herrick.</p>

<p>But the captain was again staring at the music. &ldquo;About
how long ago since you wrote up this truck?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; exclaimed Herrick. &ldquo;I
daresay half an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God, it&rsquo;s strange!&rdquo; cried Davis. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some
men would call that accidental: not me. That&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and
he drew his thick finger under the music&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I
call Providence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You said we had a chance,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>sir</i>!&rdquo; said the captain, wheeling suddenly face
to face with his companion. &ldquo;I did so. If you&rsquo;re the man
I take you for, we have a chance.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you take me for,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;You can scarce take me too low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shake hands, Mr. Herrick,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I
know you. You&rsquo;re a gentleman and a man of spirit.
I didn&rsquo;t want to speak before that bummer there; you&rsquo;ll
see why. But to you I&rsquo;ll rip it right out. I got a ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A ship?&rdquo; cried Herrick. &ldquo;What ship?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That schooner we saw this morning off the passage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That schooner with the hospital flag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the hooker,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the <i>Farallone</i>,
hundred and sixty tons register, out of &rsquo;Frisco for Sydney,
in California champagne. Captain, mate, and one hand
all died of the small-pox, same as they had round in the
Paumotus, I guess. Captain and mate were the only white
men; all the hands Kanakas; seems a queer kind of outfit
from a Christian port. Three of them left and a cook;
didn&rsquo;t know where they were; I can&rsquo;t think where they
were either, if you come to that; Wiseman must have been
on the booze, I guess, to sail the course he did. However,
there <i>he</i> was, dead; and here are the Kanakas as good as
lost. They bummed around at sea like the babes in the
wood; and tumbled end-on upon Tahiti. The consul here
took charge. He offered the berth to Williams; Williams
had never had the small-pox and backed down. That was
when I came in for the letter-paper; I thought there was
something up when the consul asked me to look in again;
but I never let on to you fellows, so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d not be disappointed.
Consul tried M&rsquo;Neil; scared of small-pox.
He tried Capirati, that Corsican, and Leblue, or whatever
his name is, wouldn&rsquo;t lay a hand on it; all too fond of their
sweet lives. Last of all, when there wasn&rsquo;t nobody else
left to offer it to, he offers it to me. &lsquo;Brown, will you ship
captain and take her to Sydney?&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Let me choose
my own mate and another white hand,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;for I don&rsquo;t
hold with this Kanaka crew racket; give us all two months&rsquo;
advance to get our clothes and instruments out of pawn,
and I&rsquo;ll take stock to-night, fill up stores, and get to sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>34</span>
to-morrow before dark!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what I said. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
good enough,&rsquo; says the consul, &lsquo;and you can count yourself
damned lucky, Brown,&rsquo; says he. And he said it pretty
meaningful-appearing too. However, that&rsquo;s all one now.
I&rsquo;ll ship Huish before the mast&mdash;of course I&rsquo;ll let him berth
aft&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll ship you mate at seventy-five dollars and two
months&rsquo; advance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me mate? Why, I&rsquo;m a landsman!&rdquo; cried Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ve got to learn,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t fancy I&rsquo;m going to skip and leave you rotting on the
beach, perhaps? I&rsquo;m not that sort, old man. And you&rsquo;re
handy, anyway; I&rsquo;ve been shipmates with worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows I can&rsquo;t refuse,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;God
knows I thank you from my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t
all.&rdquo; He turned aside to light a cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else is there?&rdquo; asked the other, with a pang of
undefinable alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that,&rdquo; said Davis, and then paused
a little. &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he began, holding out his cigar between
his finger and thumb, &ldquo;suppose you figure up what
this&rsquo;ll amount to. You don&rsquo;t catch on? Well, we get
two months&rsquo; advance; we can&rsquo;t get away from Papeete&mdash;our
creditors wouldn&rsquo;t let us go&mdash;for less; it&rsquo;ll take us along
about two months to get to Sydney; and when we get there,
I just want to put it to you squarely: What the better
are we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off the beach at least,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s a beach at Sydney,&rdquo; returned the
captain; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing, Mr. Herrick&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
mean to try. No, <i>sir</i>! Sydney will never see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak out plain,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Plain Dutch,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
own that schooner. It&rsquo;s nothing new; it&rsquo;s done every
year in the Pacific. Stephens stole a schooner the other
day, didn&rsquo;t he? Hayes and Pease stole vessels all the
time. And it&rsquo;s the making of the crowd of us. See here&mdash;you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>35</span>
think of that cargo. Champagne! why, it&rsquo;s like
as if it was put up on purpose. In Peru we&rsquo;ll sell that liquor
off at the pier-head, and the schooner after it, if we can find
a fool to buy her; and then light out for the mines. If
you&rsquo;ll back me up, I stake my life I carry it through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Herrick, with a quailing voice, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
do it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m desperate,&rdquo; returned Davis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a chance;
I may never get another. Herrick, say the word: back
me up; I think we&rsquo;ve starved together long enough for
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;m sorry. I can&rsquo;t do it. I&rsquo;ve not
fallen as low as that,&rdquo; said Herrick, deadly pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say this morning?&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;That
you couldn&rsquo;t beg? It&rsquo;s the one thing or the other, my
son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but this is the gaol!&rdquo; cried Herrick. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
tempt me. It&rsquo;s the gaol.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what the skipper said on board that
schooner?&rdquo; pursued the captain. &ldquo;Well, I tell you he
talked straight. The French have let us alone for a long
time; it can&rsquo;t last longer; they&rsquo;ve got their eye on us;
and as sure as you live, in three weeks you&rsquo;ll be in gaol
whatever you do. I read it in the consul&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget, captain,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;There
is another way. I can die; and to say truth, I think I
should have died three years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain folded his arms and looked the other in
the face. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;yes, you can cut your throat;
that&rsquo;s a frozen fact; much good may it do you! And
where do I come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The light of a strange excitement came in Herrick&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Both of us,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;both of us together. It&rsquo;s
not possible you can enjoy this business. Come,&rdquo; and he
reached out a timid hand, &ldquo;a few strokes in the lagoon&mdash;and
rest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Herrick, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;most tempted to answer you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>36</span>
the way the man does in the Bible, and say, &lsquo;<i>Get thee
behind me, Satan!</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;What! you think I
would go drown myself, and I got children starving? Enjoy
it? No, by God, I do not enjoy it! but it&rsquo;s the row I&rsquo;ve
got to hoe, and I&rsquo;ll hoe it till I drop right here. I have
three of them, you see, two boys and the one girl, Adar.
The trouble is that you are not a parent yourself. I tell
you, Herrick, I love you,&rdquo; the man broke out; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
take to you at first, you were so Anglified and tony, but I
love you now; it&rsquo;s a man that loves you stands here and
wrestles with you. I can&rsquo;t go to sea with the bummer
alone; it&rsquo;s not possible. Go drown yourself, and there
goes my last chance&mdash;the last chance of a poor miserable
beast, earning a crust to feed his family. I can&rsquo;t do nothing
but sail ships, and I&rsquo;ve no papers. And here I get a chance,
and you go back on me! Ah, you&rsquo;ve no family, and that&rsquo;s
where the trouble is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have indeed,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;you think so. But
no man&rsquo;s got a family till he&rsquo;s got children. It&rsquo;s only the
kids count. There&rsquo;s something about the little shavers ...
I can&rsquo;t talk of them. And if you thought a cent about this
father that I hear you talk of, or that sweetheart you were
writing to this morning, you would feel like me. You
would say, What matter laws, and God, and that? My
folks are hard up, I belong to them, I&rsquo;ll get them bread, or,
by God! I&rsquo;ll get them wealth, if I have to burn down
London for it. That&rsquo;s what you would say. And I&rsquo;ll tell
you more: your heart is saying so this living minute. I
can see it in your face. You&rsquo;re thinking, Here&rsquo;s poor friendship
for the man I&rsquo;ve starved along of, and as for the girl
that I set up to be in love with, here&rsquo;s a mighty limp kind
of a love that won&rsquo;t carry me as far as &lsquo;most any man would
go for a demijohn of whisky. There&rsquo;s not much <i>ro</i>mance
to that love, anyway; it&rsquo;s not the kind they carry on about
in song-books. But what&rsquo;s the good of my carrying on
talking, when it&rsquo;s all in your inside as plain as print? I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
put the question to you once for all. Are you going to
desert me in my hour of need?&mdash;you know if I&rsquo;ve deserted
you&mdash;or will you give me your hand, and try a fresh deal,
and go home (as like as not) a millionaire? Say No, and
God pity me! Say Yes, and I&rsquo;ll make the little ones pray
for you every night on their bended knees. &lsquo;God bless Mr.
Herrick:&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll say, one after the other, the
old girl sitting there holding stakes at the foot of the bed,
and the damned little innocents ...&rdquo; he broke off. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t often rip out about the kids,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but when
I do, there&rsquo;s something fetches loose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Herrick faintly, &ldquo;is there nothing
else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prophesy if you like,&rdquo; said the captain with renewed
vigour. &ldquo;Refuse this, because you think yourself
too honest, and before a month&rsquo;s out you&rsquo;ll be gaoled for
a sneak-thief. I give you the word fair. I can see it,
Herrick, if you can&rsquo;t; you&rsquo;re breaking down. Don&rsquo;t think,
if you refuse this chance, that you&rsquo;ll go on doing the evangelical;
you&rsquo;re about through with your stock; and before
you know where you are, you&rsquo;ll be right out on the other
side. No, it&rsquo;s either this for you; or else it&rsquo;s Caledonia.
I bet you never were there, and saw those white, shaved
men, in their dust-clothes and straw hats, prowling around
in gangs in the lamplight at Noumea; they look like wolves,
and they look like preachers, and they look like the sick;
Huish is a daisy to the best of them. Well, there&rsquo;s your
company. They&rsquo;re waiting for you, Herrick, and you got
to go; and that&rsquo;s a prophecy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as the man stood and shook through his great
stature, he seemed indeed like one in whom the spirit
of divination worked and might utter oracles. Herrick
looked at him, and looked away; it seemed not decent to
spy upon such agitation; and the young man&rsquo;s courage
sank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You talk of going home,&rdquo; he objected. &ldquo;We could
never do that.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>We</i> could,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;Captain Brown couldn&rsquo;t,
nor Mr. Hay that shipped mate with him couldn&rsquo;t. But
what&rsquo;s that to do with Captain Davis or Mr. Herrick, you
galoot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Hayes had these wild islands where he used to
call,&rdquo; came the next fainter objection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have the wild islands of Peru,&rdquo; retorted Davis.
&ldquo;They were wild enough for Stephens, no longer agone
than just last year. I guess they&rsquo;ll be wild enough for
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the crew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All Kanakas. Come, I see you&rsquo;re right, old man. I
see you&rsquo;ll stand by.&rdquo; And the captain once more offered
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have it your own way then,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
do it: a strange thing for my father&rsquo;s son. But I&rsquo;ll do
it. I&rsquo;ll stand by you, man, for good or evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; cried the captain, and stood silent.
&ldquo;Herrick,&rdquo; he added with a smile, &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;d have
died in my tracks if you&rsquo;d said No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Herrick, looking at the man, half believed so also.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ll go break it to the bummer,&rdquo; said
Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder how he&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him? Jump at it!&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>THE YELLOW FLAG</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> schooner <i>Farallone</i> lay well out in the jaws of the
pass, where the terrified pilot had made haste to bring her
to her moorings and escape. Seen from the beach through
the thin line of shipping, two objects stood conspicuous to
seaward: the little isle, on the one hand, with its palms
and the guns and batteries raised forty years before in
defence of Queen Pomare&rsquo;s capital; the outcast <i>Farallone</i>,
upon the other, banished to the threshold of the port, rolling
there to her scuppers, and flaunting the plague-flag as she
rolled. A few sea-birds screamed and cried about the ship;
and within easy range, a man-of-war guard-boat hung off
and on and glittered with the weapons of marines. The
exuberant daylight and the blinding heaven of the tropics
picked out and framed the pictures.</p>

<p>A neat boat, manned by natives in uniform, and steered
by the doctor of the port, put from shore towards three of
the afternoon, and pulled smartly for the schooner. The
fore-sheets were heaped with sacks of flour, onions, and
potatoes, perched among which was Huish dressed as a
foremast hand; a heap of chests and cases impeded the
action of the oarsmen; and in the stern, by the left hand
of the doctor, sat Herrick, dressed in a fresh rig of slops,
his brown beard trimmed to a point, a pile of paper novels
on his lap, and nursing the while between his feet a chronometer,
for which they had exchanged that of the <i>Farallone</i>,
long since run down and the rate lost.</p>

<p>They passed the guard-boat, exchanging hails with
the boatswain&rsquo;s mate in charge, and drew near at last to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
the forbidden ship. Not a cat stirred, there was no speech
of man; and the sea being exceeding high outside, and the
reef close to where the schooner lay, the clamour of the surf
hung round her like the sound of battle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Ohé la goëlette!</i>&rdquo; sang out the doctor, with his best
voice.</p>

<p>Instantly, from the house where they had been stowing
away stores, first Davis, and then the ragamuffin, swarthy
crew made their appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Hay, that you?&rdquo; said the captain, leaning
on the rail. &ldquo;Tell the old man to lay her alongside, as
if she was eggs. There&rsquo;s a hell of a run of sea here, and his
boat&rsquo;s brittle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The movement of the schooner was at that time more
than usually violent. Now she heaved her side as high as
a deep-sea steamer&rsquo;s, and showed the flashing of her copper;
now she swung swiftly towards the boat until her scuppers
gurgled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you have sea-legs,&rdquo; observed the doctor.
&ldquo;You will require them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed, to board the <i>Farallone</i>, in that exposed position
where she lay, was an affair of some dexterity. The less
precious goods were hoisted roughly; the chronometer,
after repeated failures, was passed gently and successfully
from hand to hand; and there remained only the more
difficult business of embarking Huish. Even that piece
of dead weight (shipped A.B. at eighteen dollars, and described
by the captain to the consul as an invaluable man)
was at last hauled on board without mishap; and the doctor,
with civil salutations, took his leave.</p>

<p>The three co-adventurers looked at each other, and
Davis heaved a breath of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get this chronometer fixed,&rdquo; said he, and
led the way into the house. It was a fairly spacious place;
two state-rooms and a good-sized pantry opened from the
main cabin; the bulk-heads were painted white, the floor
laid with waxcloth. No litter, no sign of life remained;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
for the effects of the dead men had been disinfected and
conveyed on shore. Only on the table, in a saucer, some
sulphur burned, and the fumes set them coughing as they
entered. The captain peered into the starboard state-room,
where the bed-clothes still lay tumbled in the bunk,
the blanket flung back as they had flung it back from the
disfigured corpse before its burial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I told these niggers to tumble that truck overboard,&rdquo;
grumbled Davis. &ldquo;Guess they were afraid to lay
hands on it. Well, they&rsquo;ve hosed the place out; that&rsquo;s as
much as can be expected, I suppose. Huish, lay on to
these blankets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See you blooming well far enough first,&rdquo; said Huish,
drawing back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; snapped the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell
you, my young friend, I think you make a mistake. I&rsquo;m
captain here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fat lot I care,&rdquo; returned the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll berth forward
with the niggers! Walk right out of this cabin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I dessay!&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;See any green in my
eye? A lark&rsquo;s a lark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I&rsquo;ll explain this business, and you&rsquo;ll see,
once for all, just precisely how much lark there is to it,&rdquo;
said Davis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m captain, and I&rsquo;m going to be it. One
thing of three. First, you take my orders here as cabin
steward, in which case you mess with us. Or, second, you
refuse, and I pack you forward&mdash;and you get as quick as
the word&rsquo;s said. Or, third and last, I&rsquo;ll signal that man-of-war
and send you ashore under arrest for mutiny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, of course, I wouldn&rsquo;t blow the gaff? O no!&rdquo;
replied the jeering Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who&rsquo;s to believe you, my son?&rdquo; inquired the
captain. &ldquo;No, <i>sir</i>! There ain&rsquo;t no larking about my
captainising. Enough said. Up with these blankets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huish was no fool, he knew when he was beaten; and
he was no coward either, for he stepped to the bunk, took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
the infected bed-clothes fairly in his arms, and carried them
out of the house without a check or tremor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was waiting for the chance,&rdquo; said Davis to Herrick.
&ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t do the same with you, because you understand
it for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to berth here?&rdquo; asked Herrick, following
the captain into the state-room, where he began to
adjust the chronometer in its place at the bed-head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll berth on deck.
I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;m afraid, but I&rsquo;ve no immediate use for
confluent small-pox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m afraid either,&rdquo; said Herrick.
&ldquo;But the thought of these two men sticks in my throat;
that captain and mate dying here, one opposite to the
other. It&rsquo;s grim. I wonder what they said last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wiseman and Wishart?&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Probably
mighty small potatoes. That&rsquo;s a thing a fellow figures
out for himself one way, and the real business goes quite
another. Perhaps Wiseman said, &lsquo;Here, old man, fetch
up the gin, I&rsquo;m feeling powerful rocky.&rsquo; And perhaps
Wishart said, &lsquo;O, hell!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s grim enough,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so it is,&rdquo; said Davis.&mdash;&ldquo;There; there&rsquo;s that
chronometer fixed. And now it&rsquo;s about time to up anchor
and clear out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lit a cigar and stepped on deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, you! What&rsquo;s <i>your</i> name?&rdquo; he cried to one
of the hands, a lean-flanked, clean-built fellow from some
far western island, and of a darkness almost approaching
to the African.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sally Day,&rdquo; replied the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Devil it is,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know we had
ladies on board.&mdash;Well, Sally, oblige me by hauling down
that rag there. I&rsquo;ll do the same for you another time.&rdquo;
He watched the yellow bunting as it was eased past the
cross-trees and handed down on deck. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll float no
more on this ship,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Muster the people aft,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
Mr. Hay,&rdquo; he added, speaking unnecessarily loud, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a
word to say to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was with a singular sensation that Herrick prepared
for the first time to address a crew. He thanked his stars
indeed that they were natives. But even natives, he reflected,
might be critics too quick for such a novice as himself;
they might perceive some lapse from that precise and
cut-and-dry English which prevails on board a ship; it was
even possible they understood no other; and he racked his
brain, and overhauled his reminiscences of sea romance, for
some appropriate words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, men! tumble aft!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lively now!
all hands aft!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They crowded in the alleyway like sheep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are, sir,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>For some time the captain continued to face the stern;
then turned with ferocious suddenness on the crew, and
seemed to enjoy their shrinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, twisting his cigar in his mouth and
toying with the spokes of the wheel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Captain Brown.
I command this ship. This is Mr. Hay, first officer. The
other white man is cabin steward, but he&rsquo;ll stand watch
and do his trick. My orders shall be obeyed smartly. You
savvy, &lsquo;<i>smartly</i>&rsquo;? There shall be no growling about the
kaikai, which will be above allowance. You&rsquo;ll put a handle
to the mate&rsquo;s name, and tack on &lsquo;sir&rsquo; to every order I give
you. If you&rsquo;re smart and quick, I&rsquo;ll make this ship comfortable
for all hands.&rdquo; He took the cigar out of his mouth.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; he added, in a roaring voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it
a floating hell.&mdash;Now, Mr. Hay, we&rsquo;ll pick watches, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will please use &lsquo;sir&rsquo; when you address me, Mr.
Hay,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the lady. Step to
starboard, Sally.&rdquo; And then he whispered in Herrick&rsquo;s
ear, &ldquo;Take the old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you, there,&rdquo; said Herrick.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
that you say? O, that&rsquo;s not English; I&rsquo;ll have none of
your highway gibberish on my ship. We&rsquo;ll call you old
Uncle Ned, because you&rsquo;ve got no wool on the top of your
head, just the place where the wool ought to grow. Step
to port, Uncle. Don&rsquo;t you hear Mr. Hay has picked you?
Then I&rsquo;ll take the white man. White Man, step to starboard.
Now, which of you two is the cook? You? Then
Mr. Hay takes your friend in the blue dungaree. Step to
port, Dungaree, There, we know who we all are: Dungaree,
Uncle Ned, Sally Day, White Man, and Cook. All F.F.V.&rsquo;s
I guess. And now, Mr. Hay, we&rsquo;ll up anchor, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, tell me some of the words,&rdquo;
whispered Herrick.</p>

<p>An hour later the <i>Farallone</i> was under all plain sail, the
rudder hard a-port, and the cheerfully-clanking windlass
had brought the anchor home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All clear, sir,&rdquo; cried Herrick from the bow.</p>

<p>The captain met her with the wheel, as she bounded
like a stag from her repose, trembling and bending to the
puffs. The guard-boat gave a parting hail, the wake
whitened and ran out; the <i>Farallone</i> was under weigh.</p>

<p>Her berth had been close to the pass. Even as she
forged ahead Davis slewed her for the channel between the
pier-ends of the reef, the breakers sounding and whitening
to either hand. Straight through the narrow band of blue
she shot to seaward; and the captain&rsquo;s heart exulted as
he felt her tremble underfoot, and (looking back over the
taffrail) beheld the roofs of Papeete changing position on
the shore and the island mountains rearing higher in the
wake.</p>

<p>But they were not yet done with the shore and the
horror of the yellow flag. About midway of the pass there
was a cry and a scurry, a man was seen to leap upon the
rail, and, throwing his arms over his head, to stoop and
plunge into the sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady as she goes,&rdquo; the captain cried, relinquishing
the wheel to Huish.</p>

<p>The next moment he was forward in the midst of the
Kanakas, belaying-pin in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody else for shore?&rdquo; he cried, and the savage
trumpeting of his voice, no less than the ready weapon in
his hand, struck fear in all. Stupidly they stared after
their escaped companion, whose black head was visible
upon the water, steering for the land. And the schooner
meanwhile slipped like a racer through the pass, and met
the long sea of the open ocean with a souse of spray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool that I was, not to have a pistol ready!&rdquo; exclaimed
Davis. &ldquo;Well, we go to sea short-handed; we can&rsquo;t help
that. You have a lame watch of it, Mr. Hay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we are to get along,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got to,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;No more Tahiti for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both turned instinctively and looked astern. The fair
island was unfolding mountain-top on mountain-top;
Eimeo, on the port board, lifted her splintered pinnacles;
and still the schooner raced to the open sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think!&rdquo; cried the captain, with a gesture, &ldquo;yesterday
morning I danced for my breakfast like a poodle dog.&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>THE CARGO OF CHAMPAGNE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> ship&rsquo;s head was laid to clear Eimeo to the north, and
the captain sat down in the cabin, with a chart, a ruler,
and an epitome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;East a half no&rsquo;the,&rdquo; said he, raising his face from
his labours. &ldquo;Mr. Hay, you&rsquo;ll have to watch your dead
reckoning; I want every yard she makes on every hair&rsquo;s-breadth
of a course. I&rsquo;m going to knock a hole right
straight through the Paumotus, and that&rsquo;s always a near
touch. Now, if this South East Trade ever blew out of
the S.E., which it don&rsquo;t, we might hope to lie within half
a point of our course. Say we lie within a point of it.
That&rsquo;ll just about weather Fakarava. Yes, sir, that&rsquo;s
what we&rsquo;ve got to do, if we tack for it. Brings us through
this slush of little islands in the cleanest place: see?&rdquo; And
he showed where his ruler intersected the wide-lying labyrinth
of the Dangerous Archipelago. &ldquo;I wish it was night,
and I could put her about right now; we&rsquo;re losing time
and easting. Well, we&rsquo;ll do our best. And if we don&rsquo;t
fetch Peru, we&rsquo;ll bring up to Ecuador. All one, I guess.
Depreciated dollars down, and no questions asked. A
remarkable fine institootion, the South American don.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tahiti was already some way astern, the Diadem rising
from among broken mountains&mdash;Eimeo was already close
aboard, and stood black and strange against the golden
splendour of the west&mdash;when the captain took his departure
from the two islands, and the patent log was set.</p>

<p>Some twenty minutes later, Sally Day, who was continually
leaving the wheel to peer in at the cabin clock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>47</span>
announced in a shrill cry &ldquo;Fo&rsquo; bell,&rdquo; and the cook was to
be seen carrying the soup into the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll sit down and have a pick with you,&rdquo; said
Davis to Herrick. &ldquo;By the time I&rsquo;ve done it&rsquo;ll be dark,
and we&rsquo;ll clap the hooker on the wind for South America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the cabin at one corner of the table, immediately
below the lamp, and on the lee side of a bottle of champagne,
sat Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Where did that come from?&rdquo; asked
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fizz, and it came from the after-&rsquo;old, if you want
to know,&rdquo; said Huish, and drained his mug.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This&rsquo;ll never do,&rdquo; exclaimed Davis, the merchant seaman&rsquo;s
horror of breaking into cargo showing incongruously
forth on board that stolen ship. &ldquo;There was never any
good came of games like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You byby!&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;A fellow would think
(to &rsquo;ear him) we were on the square! And look &rsquo;ere, you&rsquo;ve
put this job up &rsquo;ansomely for me, &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m to go
on deck and steer, while you two sit and guzzle, and I&rsquo;m
to go by a nickname, and got to call you &lsquo;sir&rsquo; and &lsquo;mister.&rsquo;
Well, you look here, my bloke: I&rsquo;ll have fizz <i>ad lib.</i>, or it
won&rsquo;t wash. I tell you that. And you know mighty well,
you ain&rsquo;t got any man-of-war to signal now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Davis was staggered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give fifty dollars this had
never happened,&rdquo; he said weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it <i>&rsquo;as</i> &rsquo;appened, you see,&rdquo; returned Huish.
&ldquo;Try some; it&rsquo;s devilish good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Rubicon was crossed without another struggle.
The captain filled a mug and drank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish it was beer,&rdquo; he said with a sigh. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s
no denying it&rsquo;s the genuine stuff and cheap at the money.
Now, Huish, you clear out and take your wheel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little wretch had gained a point, and he was gay.
&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; said he, and left the others to their meal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pea-soup!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain. &ldquo;Blamed if I
thought I should taste pea-soup again!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span></p>

<p>Herrick sat inert and silent. It was impossible after
these months of hopeless want to smell the rough, high-spiced
sea victuals without lust, and his mouth watered
with desire of the champagne. It was no less impossible to
have assisted at the scene between Huish and the captain,
and not to perceive, with sudden bluntness, the gulf where
he had fallen. He was a thief among thieves. He said it
to himself. He could not touch the soup. If he had
moved at all, it must have been to leave the table, throw
himself overboard, and drown&mdash;an honest man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;you look sick, old man;
have a drop of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The champagne creamed and bubbled in the mug; its
bright colour, its lively effervescence, seized his eye. &ldquo;It
is too late to hesitate,&rdquo; he thought; his hand took the mug
instinctively; he drank, with unquenchable pleasure and
desire of more; drained the vessel dry, and set it down with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something in life after all!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I
had forgot what it was like. Yes, even this is worth while.
Wine, food, dry clothes&mdash;why, they&rsquo;re worth dying, worth
hanging for! Captain, tell me one thing: why aren&rsquo;t all
the poor folk foot-pads?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be damned good,&rdquo; cried Herrick. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something here beyond me. Think of that calaboose!
Suppose we were sent suddenly back.&rdquo; He shuddered as
stung by a convulsion, and buried his face in his clutching
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo; cried the captain.
There was no reply; only Herrick&rsquo;s shoulders heaved, so
that the table was shaken. &ldquo;Take some more of this.
Here, drink this. I order you to. Don&rsquo;t start crying
when you&rsquo;re out of the wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not crying,&rdquo; said Herrick, raising his face and
showing his dry eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than crying. It&rsquo;s the
horror of that grave that we&rsquo;ve escaped from.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Come now, you tackle your soup; that&rsquo;ll fix you,&rdquo;
said Davis kindly. &ldquo;I told you you were all broken up.
You couldn&rsquo;t have stood out another week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dreadful part of it!&rdquo; cried Herrick.
&ldquo;Another week and I&rsquo;d have murdered some one for a
dollar! God! and I know that? And I&rsquo;m still living?
It&rsquo;s some beastly dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quietly, quietly! Quietly does it, my son. Take
your pea-soup. Food, that&rsquo;s what you want,&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>The soup strengthened and quieted Herrick&rsquo;s nerves;
another glass of wine, and a piece of pickled pork and fried
banana completed what the soup began; and he was able
once more to look the captain in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was so much run down,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Davis, &ldquo;you were as steady as a rock all
day: now you&rsquo;ve had a little lunch, you&rsquo;ll be as steady as
a rock again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m steady enough now, but
I&rsquo;m a queer kind of a first officer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shucks!&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only got to
mind the ship&rsquo;s course, and keep your slate to half a point.
A babby could do that, let alone a college graduate like
you. There ain&rsquo;t nothing <i>to</i> sailoring, when you come to
look it in the face. And now we&rsquo;ll go and put her about.
Bring the slate; we&rsquo;ll have to start our dead reckoning
right away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The distance run since the departure was read off the
log by the binnacle light and entered on the slate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready about,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Give me the wheel,
White Man, and you stand by the mainsheet. Boom
tackle, Mr. Hay, please, and then you can jump forward
and attend head sails.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir,&rdquo; responded Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All clear forward?&rdquo; asked Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All clear, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard a-lee!&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;Haul in your
slack as she comes,&rdquo; he called to Huish. &ldquo;Haul in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
your slack, put your back into it; keep your feet out of the
coils.&rdquo; A sudden blow sent Huish flat along the deck, and
the captain was in his place. &ldquo;Pick yourself up and keep
the wheel hard over!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;You wooden fool, you
wanted to get killed, I guess. Draw the jib,&rdquo; he cried a
moment later; and then to Huish, &ldquo;Give me the wheel
again, and see if you can coil that sheet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Huish stood and looked at Davis with an evil
countenance. &ldquo;Do you know you struck me?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know I saved your life?&rdquo; returned the other,
not deigning to look at him, his eyes travelling instead
between the compass and the sails. &ldquo;Where would you
have been if that boom had swung out and you bundled
in the slack? No, <i>sir</i>, we&rsquo;ll have no more of you at the
mainsheet. Seaport towns are full of mainsheet-men;
they hop upon one leg, my son, what&rsquo;s left of them, and the
rest are dead. (Set your boom tackle, Mr. Hay.) Struck
you, did I? Lucky for you I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Huish slowly, &ldquo;I dessay there may be
somethink in that. &rsquo;Ope there is.&rdquo; He turned his back
elaborately on the captain, and entered the house, where
the speedy explosion of a champagne cork showed he was
attending to his comfort.</p>

<p>Herrick came aft to the captain. &ldquo;How is she doing
now?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;East and by no&rsquo;the a half no&rsquo;the,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
about as good as I expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll the hands think of it?&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, they don&rsquo;t think. They ain&rsquo;t paid to,&rdquo; says the
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was something wrong, was there not? between
you and&mdash;&rdquo; Herrick paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nasty little beast; that&rsquo;s a biter,&rdquo; replied
the captain, shaking his head. &ldquo;But so long as you and
me hang in, it don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick lay down in the weather alleyway; the night
was cloudless, the movement of the ship cradled him, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
was oppressed besides by the first generous meal after so
long a time of famine; and he was recalled from deep sleep
by the voice of Davis singing out: &ldquo;Eight bells!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He rose stupidly and staggered aft, where the captain
gave him the wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the wind,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;It comes a little
puffy; when you get a heavy puff, steal all you can to windward,
but keep her a good full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stepped towards the house, paused and hailed the
forecastle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got such a thing as a concertina forward?&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Bully for you, Uncle Ned. Fetch it aft, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The schooner steered very easy; and Herrick, watching
the moon-whitened sails, was overpowered by drowsiness.
A sharp report from the cabin startled him; a third bottle
had been opened; and Herrick remembered the <i>Sea Ranger</i>
and Fourteen Island Group. Presently the notes of the
accordion sounded, and then the captain&rsquo;s voice:</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;O honey, with our pockets full of money,</p>
<p class="i05">We will trip, trip, trip, we will trip it on the quay,</p>
<p class="i05">And I will dance with Kate, and Tom will dance with Sall,</p>
<p class="i05">When we&rsquo;re all back from South Amerikee.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">So it went to its quaint air; and the watch below lingered
and listened by the forward door, and Uncle Ned was to be
seen in the moonlight nodding time; and Herrick smiled
at the wheel, his anxieties a while forgotten. Song followed
song; another cork exploded; there were voices raised,
as though the pair in the cabin were in disagreement: and
presently it seemed the breach was healed; for it was now
the voice of Huish that struck up, to the captain&rsquo;s accompaniment:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Up in a balloon, boys,</p>
  <p class="i2">Up in a balloon,</p>
<p class="i05">All among the little stars</p>
  <p class="i2">And round about the moon.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>A wave of nausea overcame Herrick at the wheel. He
wondered why the air, the words (which were yet written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
with a certain knack), and the voice and accent of the
singer, should all jar his spirit like a file on a man&rsquo;s teeth.
He sickened at the thought of his two comrades drinking
away their reason upon stolen wine, quarrelling and hiccupping
and waking up, while the doors of a prison yawned for
them in the near future. &ldquo;Shall I have sold my honour
for nothing?&rdquo; he thought; and a heat of rage and resolution
glowed in his bosom&mdash;rage against his comrades&mdash;resolution
to carry through this business if it might be
carried; pluck profit out of shame, since the shame at least
was now inevitable; and come home, home from South
America&mdash;how did the song go?&mdash;&ldquo;with his pockets full
of money.&rdquo;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;O honey, with our pockets full of money,</p>
<p class="i05">We will trip, trip, trip, we will trip it on the quay&rdquo;:</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">so the words ran in his head; and the honey took on visible
form, the quay rose before him and he knew it for the lamp-lit
Embankment, and he saw the lights of Battersea bridge
bestride the sullen river. All through the remainder of his
trick he stood entranced, reviewing the past. He had been
always true to his love, but not always sedulous to recall
her. In the growing calamity of his life, she had swum
more distant, like the moon in mist. The letter of farewell,
the dishonourable hope that had surprised and corrupted
him in his distress, the changed scene, the sea, the night
and the music&mdash;all stirred him to the roots of manhood.
&ldquo;I <i>will</i> win her,&rdquo; he thought, and ground his teeth. &ldquo;Fair
or foul, what matters if I win her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fo&rsquo; bell, matey. I think um fo&rsquo; bell&rdquo;&mdash;he was suddenly
recalled by these words in the voice of Uncle Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look in at the clock, Uncle,&rdquo; said he. He would not
look himself, from horror of the tipplers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Him past, matey,&rdquo; repeated the Hawaiian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So much the better for you, Uncle,&rdquo; he replied; and
he gave up the wheel, repeating the directions as he had
received them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span></p>

<p>He took two steps forward and remembered his dead
reckoning. &ldquo;How has she been heading?&rdquo; he thought;
and he flushed from head to foot. He had not observed or
had forgotten; here was the old incompetence; the slate
must be filled up by guess. &ldquo;Never again!&rdquo; he vowed to
himself in silent fury, &ldquo;never again. It shall be no fault of
mine if this miscarry.&rdquo; And for the remainder of his watch
he stood close by Uncle Ned, and read the face of the
compass as perhaps he had never read a letter from his
sweetheart.</p>

<p>All the time, and spurring him to the more attention,
song, loud talk, fleering laughter, and the occasional popping
of a cork, reached his ears from the interior of the house;
and when the port watch was relieved at midnight, Huish
and the captain appeared upon the quarter-deck with flushed
faces and uneven steps, the former laden with bottles, the
latter with two tin mugs. Herrick silently passed them by.
They hailed him in thick voices, he made no answer;
they cursed him for a churl, he paid no heed although his
belly quivered with disgust and rage. He closed-to the
door of the house behind him, and cast himself on a locker
in the cabin&mdash;not to sleep, he thought&mdash;rather to think and
to despair. Yet he had scarce turned twice on his uneasy
bed, before a drunken voice hailed him in the ear, and he
must go on deck again to stand the morning watch.</p>

<p>The first evening set the model for those that were to
follow. Two cases of champagne scarce lasted the four-and-twenty
hours, and almost the whole was drunk by Huish
and the captain. Huish seemed to thrive on the excess;
he was never sober, yet never wholly tipsy; the food and the
sea air had soon healed him of his disease, and he began to
lay on flesh. But with Davis things went worse. In the
drooping, unbuttoned figure that sprawled all day upon the
lockers, tippling and reading novels; in the fool who made
of the evening watch a public carouse on the quarter-deck,
it would have been hard to recognise the vigorous seaman of
Papeete roads. He kept himself reasonably well in hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
till he had taken the sun and yawned and blotted through
his calculations; but from the moment he rolled up the
chart, his hours were passed in slavish self-indulgence or in
hoggish slumber. Every other branch of his duty was
neglected, except maintaining a stern discipline about the
dinner-table. Again and again Herrick would hear the cook
called aft, and see him running with fresh tins, or carrying
away again a meal that had been totally condemned. And
the more the captain became sunk in drunkenness, the more
delicate his palate showed itself. Once, in the forenoon,
he had a bo&rsquo;sun&rsquo;s chair rigged over the rail, stripped to his
trousers, and went overboard with a pot of paint. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like the way this schooner&rsquo;s painted,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
taken a down upon her name.&rdquo; But he tired of it in half
an hour, and the schooner went on her way with an incongruous
patch of colour on the stern, and the word <i>Farallone</i>
part obliterated and part looking through. He refused to
stand either the middle or morning watch. It was fine-weather
sailing, he said; and asked, with a laugh, &ldquo;Who
ever heard of the old man standing watch himself?&rdquo; To
the dead reckoning which Herrick still tried to keep, he
would pay not the least attention nor afford the least
assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do we want of dead reckoning?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;We get the sun all right, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We mayn&rsquo;t get it always, though,&rdquo; objected Herrick.
&ldquo;And you told me yourself you weren&rsquo;t sure of the chronometer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, there ain&rsquo;t no flies in the chronometer!&rdquo; cried
Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oblige me so far, captain,&rdquo; said Herrick stiffly. &ldquo;I
am anxious to keep this reckoning, which is a part of my
duty; I do not know what to allow for current, nor how to
allow for it. I am too inexperienced; and I beg of you
to help me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never discourage zealous officer,&rdquo; said the captain,
unrolling the chart again, for Herrick had taken him over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
his day&rsquo;s work, and while he was still partly sober. &ldquo;Here
it is: look for yourself; anything from west to west no&rsquo;thewest,
and anyways from five to twenty-five miles. That&rsquo;s
what the A&rsquo;m&rsquo;ralty chart says; I guess you don&rsquo;t expect
to get on ahead of your own Britishers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am trying to do my duty, Captain Brown,&rdquo; said
Herrick, with a dark flush, &ldquo;and I have the honour to
inform you that I don&rsquo;t enjoy being trifled with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What in thunder do you want?&rdquo; roared Davis. &ldquo;Go
and look at the blamed wake. If you&rsquo;re trying to do your
duty, why don&rsquo;t you go and do it? I guess it&rsquo;s no business
of mine to go and stick my head over the ship&rsquo;s rump? I
guess it&rsquo;s yours. And I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, my fine fellow,
I&rsquo;ll trouble you not to come the dude over me. You&rsquo;re
insolent, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s wrong with you. Don&rsquo;t you crowd
me, Mr. Herrick, Esquire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick tore up his papers, threw them on the floor, and
left the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s turned a bloomin&rsquo; swot, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; sneered
Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thinks himself too good for his company, that&rsquo;s
what ails Herrick, Esquire,&rdquo; raged the captain. &ldquo;He
thinks I don&rsquo;t understand when he comes the heavy swell.
Won&rsquo;t sit down with us, won&rsquo;t he? won&rsquo;t say a civil word?
I&rsquo;ll serve the son of a gun as he deserves. By God, Huish,
I&rsquo;ll show him whether he&rsquo;s too good for John Davis!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy with the names, cap&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Huish, who was
always the more sober. &ldquo;Easy over the stones, my
boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I will. You&rsquo;re a good sort, Huish. I didn&rsquo;t
take to you at first, but I guess you&rsquo;re right enough. Let&rsquo;s
open another bottle,&rdquo; said the captain; and that day, perhaps
because he was excited by the quarrel, he drank more
recklessly, and by four o&rsquo;clock was stretched insensible upon
the locker.</p>

<p>Herrick and Huish supped alone, one after the other,
opposite his flushed and snorting body. And if the sight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
killed Herrick&rsquo;s hunger, the isolation weighed so heavily on
the clerk&rsquo;s spirit that he was scarce risen from table ere he
was currying favour with his former comrade.</p>

<p>Herrick was at the wheel when he approached, and
Huish leaned confidentially across the binnacle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, old chappie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you and me don&rsquo;t seem
to be such pals somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick gave her a spoke or two in silence; his eye, as it
skirted from the needle to the luff of the foresail, passed the
man by without speculation. But Huish was really dull,
a thing he could support with difficulty, having no resources
of his own. The idea of a private talk with Herrick, at this
stage of their relations, held out particular inducements to
a person of his character. Drink besides, as it renders some
men hyper-sensitive, made Huish callous. And it would
almost have required a blow to make him quit his
purpose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty business, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;Dyvis on
the lush? Must say I thought you gave it &rsquo;im A1 to-day.
He didn&rsquo;t like it a bit; took on hawful after you were gone.&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;Ere,&rsquo;
says I, &lsquo;&rsquo;old on, easy on the lush,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;&rsquo;Errick
was right and you know it. Give &rsquo;im a chanst,&rsquo; I says.&mdash;&rsquo; &lsquo;Uish,&rsquo;
sezee, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you gimme no more of your jaw, or
I&rsquo;ll knock your bloomin&rsquo; eyes out.&rsquo; Well, wot can I do,
&rsquo;Errick? But I tell you, I don&rsquo;t &rsquo;arf like it. It looks to me
like the <i>Sea Rynger</i> over again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still Herrick was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you &rsquo;ear me speak?&rdquo; asked Huish sharply.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pleasant, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand away from that binnacle,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>The clerk looked at him long and straight and black;
his figure seemed to writhe like that of a snake about to
strike; then he turned on his heel, went back to the cabin
and opened a bottle of champagne. When eight bells were
cried he slept on the floor beside the captain on the locker;
and of the whole starboard watch only Sally Day appeared
upon the summons. The mate proposed to stand the watch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
with him, and let Uncle Ned lie down; it would make twelve
hours on deck, and probably sixteen, but in this fair-weather
sailing he might safely sleep between his tricks of wheel,
leaving orders to be called on any sign of squalls. So far he
could trust the men, between whom and himself a close
relation had sprung up. With Uncle Ned he held long
nocturnal conversations, and the old man told him his
simple and hard story of exile, suffering, and injustice among
cruel whites. The cook, when he found Herrick messed
alone, produced for him unexpected and sometimes unpalatable
dainties, of which he forced himself to eat. And one
day, when he was forward, he was surprised to feel a caressing
hand run down his shoulder, and to hear the voice of
Sally Day crooning in his ear: &ldquo;You gootch man!&rdquo; He
turned, and, choking down a sob, shook hands with the
negrito. They were kindly, cheery, childish souls. Upon
the Sunday each brought forth his separate Bible&mdash;for they
were all men of alien speech, even to each other, and Sally
Day communicated with his mates in English only; each
read or made-believe to read his chapter, Uncle Ned with
spectacles on his nose; and they would all join together in
the singing of missionary hymns. It was thus a cutting
reproof to compare the islanders and the whites aboard the
<i>Farallone</i>. Shame ran in Herrick&rsquo;s blood to remember
what employment he was on, and to see these poor souls&mdash;and
even Sally Day, the child of cannibals, in all likelihood
a cannibal himself&mdash;so faithful to what they knew of good.
The fact that he was held in grateful favour by these innocents
served like blinders to his conscience, and there were
times when he was inclined, with Sally Day, to call himself
a good man. But the height of his favour was only now to
appear. With one voice, the crew protested; ere Herrick
knew what they were doing, the cook was aroused and came
a willing volunteer; all hands clustered about their mate
with expostulations and caresses; and he was bidden to lie
down and take his customary rest without alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He tell you tlue,&rdquo; said Uncle Ned. &ldquo;You sleep.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
Evely man hea he do all light. Evely man he like you too
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick struggled, and gave way; choked upon some
trivial words of gratitude; and walked to the side of the
house, against which he leaned, struggling with emotion.</p>

<p>Uncle Ned presently followed him and begged him to lie
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Uncle Ned,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.
I&rsquo;m knocked over with all your goodness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, no call me Uncle Ned no mo&rsquo;!&rdquo; cried the old man.
&ldquo;No my name! My name Taveeta, all-e-same Taveeta
King of Islael. Wat for he call that Hawaii? I think no
savvy nothing&mdash;all-e-same Wise-a-mana.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the first time the name of the late captain had been
mentioned, and Herrick grasped the occasion. The reader
shall be spared Uncle Ned&rsquo;s unwieldy dialect, and learn in
less embarrassing English the sum of what he now communicated.
The ship had scarce cleared the Golden Gates
before the captain and mate had entered on a career of
drunkenness, which was scarcely interrupted by their malady
and only closed by death. For days and weeks they had
encountered neither land nor ship; and seeing themselves
lost on the huge deep with their insane conductors, the
natives had drunk deep of terror.</p>

<p>At length they made a low island and went in; and Wiseman
and Wishart landed in the boat.</p>

<p>There was a great village, a very fine village, and plenty
Kanakas in that place; but all mighty serious; and from
every here and there in the back parts of the settlement,
Taveeta heard the sounds of island lamentation. &ldquo;I no
savvy <i>talk</i> that island,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I savvy hear um <i>cly</i>.
I think, Hum! too many people die here!&rdquo; But upon
Wiseman and Wishart the significance of that barbaric
keening was lost. Full of bread and drink, they rollicked
along unconcerned, embraced the girls, who had scarce
energy to repel them, took up and joined (with drunken
voices) in the death-wail, and at last (on what they took to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
be an invitation) entered under the roof of a house in which
was a considerable concourse of people sitting silent. They
stooped below the eaves, flushed and laughing; within a
minute they came forth again with changed faces and silent
tongues; and as the press severed to make way for them,
Taveeta was able to perceive, in the deep shadow of the
house, the sick man raising from his mat a head already
defeatured by disease. The two tragic triflers fled without
hesitation for their boat, screaming on Taveeta to make
haste; they came aboard with all speed of oars, raised anchor
and crowded sail upon the ship with blows and curses, and
were at sea again&mdash;and again drunk&mdash;before sunset. A
week after, and the last of the two had been committed to
the deep. Herrick asked Taveeta where that island was,
and he replied that, by what he gathered of folks&rsquo; talk as
they went up together from the beach, he supposed it must
be one of the Paumotus. This was in itself probable enough,
for the Dangerous Archipelago had been swept that year
from east to west by devastating small-pox; but Herrick
thought it a strange course to lie from Sydney. Then he
remembered the drink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were they not surprised when they made the island?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wise-a-mana he say, &lsquo;damn! what this?&rsquo;&rdquo; was the
reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s it, then,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe
they knew where they were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so too,&rdquo; said Uncle Ned. &ldquo;I think no savvy.
This one mo&rsquo; betta,&rdquo; he added, pointing to the house, where
the drunken captain slumbered: &ldquo;Take-a-sun all-e-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The implied last touch completed Herrick&rsquo;s picture of
the life and death of his two predecessors; of their prolonged,
sordid, sodden sensuality as they sailed, they knew
not whither, on their last cruise. He held but a twinkling
and unsure belief in any future state; the thought of one of
punishment he derided; yet for him (as for all) there dwelt
a horror about the end of the brutish man. Sickness fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
upon him at the image thus called up; and when he compared
it with the scene in which he himself was acting, and
considered the doom that seemed to brood upon the schooner,
a horror that was almost superstitious fell upon him. And
yet the strange thing was, he did not falter. He who had
proved his incapacity in so many fields, being now falsely
placed amid duties which he did not understand, without
help, and it might be said without countenance, had hitherto
surpassed expectation; and even the shameful misconduct
and shocking disclosures of that night seemed but to nerve
and strengthen him. He had sold his honour; he vowed it
should not be in vain; &ldquo;it shall be no fault of mine if this
miscarry,&rdquo; he repeated. And in his heart he wondered at
himself. Living rage no doubt supported him; no doubt
also, the sense of the last cast, of the ships burned, of all doors
closed but one, which is so strong a tonic to the merely weak,
and so deadly a depressent to the merely cowardly.</p>

<p>For some time the voyage went otherwise well. They
weathered Fakarava with one board; and the wind holding
well to the southward, and blowing fresh, they passed between
Ranaka and Ratiu, and ran some days north-east by
east-half-east under the lee of Takume and Honden, neither
of which they made. In about 14° south, and between 134°
and 135° west, it fell a dead calm, with rather a heavy sea.
The captain refused to take in sail, the helm was lashed, no
watch was set, and the <i>Farallone</i> rolled and banged for three
days, according to observation, in almost the same place.
The fourth morning, a little before day, a breeze sprang up
and rapidly freshened. The captain had drunk hard the
night before; he was far from sober when he was roused;
and when he came on deck for the first time at half-past
eight, it was plain he had already drunk deep again at breakfast.
Herrick avoided his eye; and resigned the deck with
indignation to a man more than half-seas-over.</p>

<p>By the loud commands of the captain and the singing
out of fellows at the ropes, he could judge from the house
that sail was being crowded on the ship; relinquished his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
half-eaten breakfast; and came on deck again, to find the
main and the jib topsails set, and both watches and the cook
turned out to hand the staysail. The <i>Farallone</i> lay already
far over; the sky was obscured with misty scud; and from
the windward an ominous squall came flying up, broadening
and blackening as it rose.</p>

<p>Fear thrilled in Herrick&rsquo;s vitals. He saw death hard
by; and if not death, sure ruin. For if the <i>Farallone</i> lived
through the coming squall, she must surely be dismasted.
With that their enterprise was at an end, and they themselves
bound prisoners to the very evidence of their crime.
The greatness of the peril and his own alarm sufficed to
silence him. Pride, wrath, and shame raged without issue
in his mind; and he shut his teeth and folded his arms
close.</p>

<p>The captain sat in the boat to windward, bellowing orders
and insults, his eyes glazed, his face deeply congested; a
bottle set between his knees, a glass in his hand half empty.
His back was to the squall, and he was at first intent upon
the setting of the sail. When that was done, and the great
trapezium of canvas had begun to draw and to trail the lee-rail
of the <i>Farallone</i> level with the foam, he laughed out an
empty laugh, drained his glass, sprawled back among the
lumber in the boat, and fetched out a crumpled novel.</p>

<p>Herrick watched him, and his indignation glowed red-hot.
He glanced to windward where the squall already
whitened the near sea and heralded its coming with a singular
and dismal sound. He glanced at the steersman, and saw
him clinging to the spokes with a face of a sickly blue. He
saw the crew were running to their stations without orders.
And it seemed as if something broke in his brain; and the
passion of anger, so long restrained, so long eaten in secret,
burst suddenly loose and shook him like a sail. He stepped
across to the captain, and smote his hand heavily on the
drunkard&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You brute,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that tottered, &ldquo;look
behind you!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Davis, bounding in the boat and
upsetting the champagne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lost the <i>Sea Ranger</i> because you were a drunken
sot,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re going to lose the <i>Farallone</i>.
You&rsquo;re going to drown here the same way as you drowned
others, and be damned. And your daughter shall walk the
streets, and your sons be thieves like their father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the moment the words struck the captain white and
foolish. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried, looking at Herrick as upon
a ghost; &ldquo;my God, Herrick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look behind you, then!&rdquo; reiterated the assailant.</p>

<p>The wretched man, already partly sobered, did as he
was told, and in the same breath of time leaped to his feet.
&ldquo;Down staysail!&rdquo; he trumpeted. The hands were thrilling
for the order, and the great sail came with a run, and fell
half overboard among the racing foam. &ldquo;Jib top-sail
halyards! Let the stays&rsquo;l be,&rdquo; he said again.</p>

<p>But before it was well uttered, the squall shouted aloud
and fell, in a solid mass of wind and rain commingled, on the
<i>Farallone</i>; and she stooped under the blow, and lay like
a thing dead. From the mind of Herrick reason fled; he
clung in the weather rigging, exulting; he was done with
life, and he gloried in the release; he gloried in the wild
noises of the wind and the choking onslaught of the rain;
he gloried to die so, and now, amid this coil of the elements.
And meanwhile, in the waist, up to his knees in water&mdash;so
low the schooner lay&mdash;the captain was hacking at the fore-sheet
with a pocket-knife. It was a question of seconds,
for the <i>Farallone</i> drank deep of the encroaching seas. But
the hand of the captain had the advance; the foresail boom
tore apart the last strands of the sheet and crashed to lee-ward;
the <i>Farallone</i> leaped up into the wind and righted;
and the peak and throat halyards, which had long been let
go, began to run at the same instant.</p>

<p>For some ten minutes more she careered under the impulse
of the squall; but the captain was now master of himself
and of his ship, and all danger at an end. And then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
sudden as a trick-change upon the stage, the squall blew by,
the wind dropped into light airs, the sun beamed forth again
upon the tattered schooner; and the captain, having secured
the foresail boom and set a couple of hands to the pump,
walked aft, sober, a little pale, and with the sodden end of a
cigar still stuck between his teeth even as the squall had
found it. Herrick followed him; he could scarce recall the
violence of his late emotions, but he felt there was a scene
to go through, and he was anxious and even eager to go
through with it.</p>

<p>The captain, turning at the house-end, met him face to
face, and averted his eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost the two tops&rsquo;ls,
and the stays&rsquo;l,&rdquo; he gabbled. &ldquo;Good business we didn&rsquo;t
lose any sticks. I guess you think we&rsquo;re all the better
without the kites.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; said Herrick, in a voice
strangely quiet, that yet echoed confusion in the captain&rsquo;s
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; he cried, holding up his hand. &ldquo;I know
what you&rsquo;re thinking. No use to say it now. I&rsquo;m sober.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to say it, though,&rdquo; returned Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Herrick; you&rsquo;ve said enough,&rdquo; said Davis.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said what I would take from no man breathing
but yourself; only I know it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to tell you, Captain Brown,&rdquo; pursued Herrick,
&ldquo;that I resign my position as mate. You can put me in
irons or shoot me, as you please; I will make no resistance&mdash;only,
I decline in any way to help or to obey you; and I
suggest you should put Mr. Huish in my place. He will
make a worthy first officer to your captain, sir.&rdquo; He smiled,
bowed, and turned to walk forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Herrick?&rdquo; cried the captain,
detaining him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To berth forward with the men, sir,&rdquo; replied Herrick,
with the same hateful smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been long enough aft
here with you&mdash;gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong there,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
too quick with me; there ain&rsquo;t nothing wrong but the drink&mdash;it&rsquo;s
the old story, man! Let me get sober once and then
you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I desire to see no more of you,&rdquo; said
Herrick.</p>

<p>The captain groaned aloud. &ldquo;You know what you said
about my children?&rdquo; he broke out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By rote. In case you wish me to say it to you
again?&rdquo; asked Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried the captain clapping his hands to his
ears. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make me kill a man I care for! Herrick,
if you see me put a glass to my lips again till we&rsquo;re ashore,
I give you leave to put a bullet through me; I beg you to do
it! You&rsquo;re the only man aboard whose carcase is worth
losing; do you think I don&rsquo;t know that? do you think I
ever went back on you? I always knew you were in the
right of it&mdash;drunk or sober, I knew that. What do you
want?&mdash;an oath? Man, you&rsquo;re clever enough to see that
this is sure-enough earnest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean there shall be no more drinking?&rdquo; asked
Herrick, &ldquo;neither by you nor Huish? that you won&rsquo;t go on
stealing my profits and drinking my champagne that I gave
my honour for? and that you&rsquo;ll attend to your duties, and
stand watch and watch, and bear your proper share of the
ship&rsquo;s work, instead of leaving it all on the shoulders of a
landsman, and making yourself the butt and scoff of native
seamen? Is that what you mean? If it is, be so good as
to say it categorically.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You put these things in a way hard for a gentleman
to swallow,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have me
say I was ashamed of myself? Trust me this once; I&rsquo;ll do
the square thing, and there&rsquo;s my hand on it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try it once,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;Fail me
again....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more now!&rdquo; interrupted Davis. &ldquo;No more, old
man! Enough said. You&rsquo;ve a riling tongue when your
back&rsquo;s up, Herrick. Just be glad we&rsquo;re friends again, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
same as what I am; and go tender on the raws; I&rsquo;ll see as
you don&rsquo;t repent it. We&rsquo;ve been mighty near death this
day&mdash;don&rsquo;t say whose fault it was!&mdash;pretty near hell, too, I
guess. We&rsquo;re in a mighty bad line of life, us two, and ought
to go easy with each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was maundering; yet it seemed as if he were
maundering with some design, beating about the bush of
some communication that he feared to make, or perhaps
only talking against time in terror of what Herrick might
say next. But Herrick had now spat his venom; his was
a kindly nature, and, content with his triumph, he had now
begun to pity. With a few soothing words he sought to
conclude the interview, and proposed that they should
change their clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not right yet,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another thing I
want to tell you first. You know what you said about my
children? I want to tell you why it hit me so hard; I kind
of think you&rsquo;ll feel bad about it too. It&rsquo;s about my little
Adar. You hadn&rsquo;t ought to have quite said that&mdash;but of
course I know you didn&rsquo;t know. She&mdash;she&rsquo;s dead, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Davis!&rdquo; cried Herrick. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me a
dozen times she was alive! Clear your head, man! This
must be the drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <i>sir</i>,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s dead. Died of a bowel
complaint. That was when I was away in the brig <i>Oregon</i>.
She lies in Portland, Maine. &lsquo;Adar, only daughter of
Captain John Davis and Mariar his wife, aged five.&rsquo; I had
a doll for her on board. I never took the paper off&rsquo;n that
doll, Herrick; it went down the way it was with the <i>Sea
Ranger</i>, that day I was damned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the horizon; he talked
with an extraordinary softness, but a complete composure;
and Herrick looked upon him with something that was
almost terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m crazy neither,&rdquo; resumed Davis.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve all the cold sense that I know what to do with. But I
guess a man that&rsquo;s unhappy&rsquo;s like a child; and this is a kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
of a child&rsquo;s game of mine. I never could act up to the plain-cut
truth, you see; so I pretend. And I warn you square;
as soon as we&rsquo;re through with this talk, I&rsquo;ll start in again
with the pretending. Only, you see, she can&rsquo;t walk no
streets,&rdquo; added the captain, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t even make out to
live and get that doll!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick laid a tremulous hand upon the captain&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; cried Davis, recoiling from the touch.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m all broken up the way it is? Come
along, then; come along, old man; you can put your trust
in me right through; come along and get dry clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They entered the cabin, and there was Huish on his
knees prizing open a case of champagne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Vast there!&rdquo; cried the captain. &ldquo;No more of that.
No more drinking on this ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turned teetotal, &rsquo;ave you?&rdquo; inquired Huish. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
agreeable. About time, eh? Bloomin&rsquo; nearly lost another
ship, I fancy.&rdquo; He took out a bottle and began calmly to
burst the wire with the spike of a corkscrew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear me speak?&rdquo; cried Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I do. You speak loud enough,&rdquo; said Huish.
&ldquo;The trouble is that I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick plucked the captain&rsquo;s sleeve. &ldquo;Let him
free now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had all we want this
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him have it, then,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s his
last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the wire was open, the string was cut, the
head of gilded paper was torn away; and Huish waited,
mug in hand, expecting the usual explosion. It did not
follow. He eased the cork with his thumb; still there was
no result. At last he took the screw and drew it. It came
out very easy and with scarce a sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Illo!&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s a bad bottle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He poured some of the wine into the mug; it was colourless
and still. He smelt and tasted it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, wot&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s water!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the voice of trumpets had suddenly sounded about
the ship in the midst of the sea, the three men in the house
could scarcely have been more stunned than by this incident.
The mug passed round; each sipped, each smelt of it; each
stared at the bottle in its glory of gold paper as Crusoe may
have stared at the footprint; and their minds were swift to
fix upon a common apprehension. The difference between
a bottle of champagne and a bottle of water is not great;
between a shipload of one or of the other lay the whole scale
from riches to ruin.</p>

<p>A second bottle was broached. There were two cases
standing ready in a state-room; these two were brought out,
broken open, and tested. Still with the same result: the
contents were still colourless and tasteless, and dead as the
rain in a beached fishing-boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crikey!&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, let&rsquo;s sample the hold,&rdquo; said the captain, mopping
his brow with a back-handed sweep; and the three stalked
out of the house, grim and heavy-footed.</p>

<p>All hands were turned out; two Kanakas were sent
below, another stationed at a purchase; and Davis, axe in
hand, took his place beside the coamings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you going to let the men know?&rdquo; whispered
Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn the men!&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond that.
We&rsquo;ve got to know ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three cases were sent on deck and sampled in turn;
from each bottle, as the captain smashed it with the axe, the
champagne ran bubbling and creaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go deeper, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; cried Davis to the Kanakas
in the hold.</p>

<p>The command gave the signal for a disastrous change.
Case after case came up, bottle after bottle was burst, and
bled mere water. Deeper yet, and they came upon a layer
where there was scarcely so much as the intention to deceive;
where the cases were no longer branded, the bottles no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
longer wired or papered, where the fraud was manifest and
stared them in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s about enough of this foolery!&rdquo; said Davis.
&ldquo;Stow back the cases in the hold, Uncle, and get the broken
crockery overboard. Come with me,&rdquo; he added to his co-adventurers,
and led the way back into the cabin.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>THE PARTNERS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Each</span> took a side of the fixed table; it was the first time they
had sat down at it together; but now all sense of incongruity,
all memory of differences, was quite swept away by the
presence of the common ruin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the captain, after a pause, and with
very much the air of a chairman opening a board meeting,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re sold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huish broke out in laughter. &ldquo;Well, if this ain&rsquo;t the
&rsquo;ighest old rig!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;And Dyvis &rsquo;ere, who thought
he had got up so bloomin&rsquo; early in the mornin&rsquo;! We&rsquo;ve
stolen a cargo of spring water! O, my crikey!&rdquo; and he
squirmed with mirth.</p>

<p>The captain managed to screw out a phantom smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Old Man Destiny again,&rdquo; said he to Herrick,
&ldquo;but this time I guess he&rsquo;s kicked the door right in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick only shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Lord, it&rsquo;s rich!&rdquo; laughed Huish. &ldquo;It would really
be a scrumptious lark if it &rsquo;ad &rsquo;appened to somebody
else! And what are we to do next? O, my eye! with this
bloomin&rsquo; schooner, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one
thing certain: it&rsquo;s no use carting this old glass and ballast
to Peru. No, <i>sir</i>, we&rsquo;re in a hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O my, and the merchant!&rdquo; cried Huish; &ldquo;the man
that made this shipment! He&rsquo;ll get the news by the mail
brigantine; and he&rsquo;ll think of course we&rsquo;re making straight
for Sydney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;ll be a sick merchant,&rdquo; said the captain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
&ldquo;One thing: this explains the Kanaka crew. If you&rsquo;re
going to lose a ship, I would ask no better myself than a
Kanaka crew. But there&rsquo;s one thing it don&rsquo;t explain; it
don&rsquo;t explain why she came down Tahitiways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;y, to lose her, you byby!&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot you know,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Nobody wants
to lose a schooner; they want to lose her <i>on her course</i>, you
skeericks! You seem to think underwriters haven&rsquo;t got
enough sense to come in out of the rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;I can tell you (I am afraid) why
she came so far to the eastward. I had it of Uncle Ned.
It seems these two unhappy devils, Wiseman and Wishart,
were drunk on the champagne from the beginning&mdash;and died
drunk at the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain looked on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They lay in their two bunks, or sat here in this damned
house,&rdquo; he pursued, with rising agitation, &ldquo;filling their
skins with the accursed stuff, till sickness took them. As
they sickened and the fever rose, they drank the more.
They lay here howling and groaning, drunk and dying, all
in one. They didn&rsquo;t know where they were; they didn&rsquo;t
care. They didn&rsquo;t even take the sun, it seems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not take the sun?&rdquo; cried the captain, looking up.
&ldquo;Sacred Billy! what a crowd!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it don&rsquo;t matter to Joe!&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;Wot are
Wiseman and t&rsquo;other buffer to us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A good deal, too,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re their
heirs, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a great inheritance,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; returned Davis.
&ldquo;Appears to me as if it might be worse. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t worth what
the cargo would have been, of course, at least not money
down. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what it appears to figure up to.
Appears to me as if it amounted to about the bottom dollar
of the man in &rsquo;Frisco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Old on,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;Give a fellow time; &rsquo;ow&rsquo;s
this, umpire?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my sons,&rdquo; pursued the captain, who seemed to
have recovered his assurance, &ldquo;Wiseman and Wishart were
to be paid for casting away this old schooner and its cargo.
We&rsquo;re going to cast away the schooner right enough; and I&rsquo;ll
make it my private business to see that we get paid. What
were W. and W. to get? That&rsquo;s more&rsquo;n I can tell. But
W. and W. went into this business themselves, they were on
the crook. Now <i>we&rsquo;re</i> on the square, <i>we</i> only stumbled into
it; and that merchant has just got to squeal, and I&rsquo;m the
man to see that he squeals good. No, <i>sir</i>! there&rsquo;s some
stuffing to this <i>Farallone</i> racket after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go it, cap&rsquo;!&rdquo; cried Huish. &ldquo;Yoicks! Forrard!
&rsquo;Old &rsquo;ard! There&rsquo;s your style for the money! Blow me if
I don&rsquo;t prefer this to the hother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I have to ask
you to excuse me; I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, see here, Herrick,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to have a word with you anyway upon a different
matter, and it&rsquo;s good that Huish should hear it too. We&rsquo;re
done with this boozing business, and we ask your pardon for
it right here and now. We have to thank you for all you
did for us while we were making hogs of ourselves; you&rsquo;ll
find me turn-to all right in future; and as for the wine,
which I grant we stole from you, I&rsquo;ll take stock and see you
paid for it. That&rsquo;s good enough, I believe. But what I
want to point out to you is this. The old game was a risky
game. The new game&rsquo;s as safe as running a Vienna bakery.
We just put this <i>Farallone</i> before the wind, and run till we&rsquo;re
well to looard of our port of departure, and reasonably well
up with some other place where they have an American
consul. Down goes the <i>Farallone</i>, and good-bye to her! A
day or so in the boat; the consul packs us home, at Uncle
Sam&rsquo;s expense, to &rsquo;Frisco; and if that merchant don&rsquo;t put
the dollars down, you come to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I thought&mdash;&rdquo; began Herrick; and then broke
out: &ldquo;O, let&rsquo;s get on to Peru!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re going to Peru for your health, I won&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
say no!&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;But for what other blame
shadow of a reason you should want to go there gets me clear.
We don&rsquo;t want to go there with this cargo; I don&rsquo;t know as
old bottles is a lively article anywheres; leastways, I&rsquo;ll go
my bottom cent, it ain&rsquo;t Peru. It was always a doubt if we
could sell the schooner; I never rightly hoped to, and now
I&rsquo;m sure she ain&rsquo;t worth a hill of beans; what&rsquo;s wrong with
her I don&rsquo;t know; I only know it&rsquo;s something, or she
wouldn&rsquo;t be here with this truck in her inside. Then again,
if we lose her, and land in Peru, where are we? We can&rsquo;t
declare the loss, or how did we get to Peru? In that case
the merchant can&rsquo;t touch the insurance; most likely he&rsquo;ll
go bust; and don&rsquo;t you think you see the three of us on the
beach of Callao?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no extradition there,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my son, and we want to be extraded,&rdquo; said the
captain. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s our point? We want to have a consul
extrade us as far as San Francisco and that merchant&rsquo;s
office door. My idea is that Samoa would be found an
eligible business centre. It&rsquo;s dead before the wind; the
States have a consul there, and &rsquo;Frisco steamers call, so&rsquo;s
we could skip right back and interview the merchant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Samoa?&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;It will take us for ever to
get there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, with a fair wind!&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No trouble about the log, eh?&rdquo; asked Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <i>sir</i>,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;<i>Light airs and baffling winds.
Squalls and calms. D.R.: five miles. No obs. Pumps
attended.</i> And fill in the barometer and thermometer off
of last year&rsquo;s trip. &lsquo;Never saw such a voyage,&rsquo; says you to
the consul. &lsquo;Thought I was going to run short...&rsquo;&rdquo; He
stopped in mid career. &ldquo;&rsquo;Say,&rdquo; he began again, and once
more stopped. &ldquo;Beg your pardon, Herrick,&rdquo; he added
with undisguised humility, &ldquo;but did you keep the run of
the stores?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had I been told to do so it should have been done, as
the rest was done, to the best of my little ability,&rdquo; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
Herrick. &ldquo;As it was, the cook helped himself to what he
pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Davis looked at the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drew it rather fine, you see,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;The
great thing was to clear right out of Papeete before the
consul could think better of it. Tell you what: I guess I&rsquo;ll
take stock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he rose from the table and disappeared with a lamp
in the lazarette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s another screw loose,&rdquo; observed Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My man,&rdquo; said Herrick, with a sudden gleam of
animosity, &ldquo;it is still your watch on deck, and surely your
wheel also?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come the &rsquo;eavy swell, don&rsquo;t you, ducky?&rdquo; said
Huish. &ldquo;Stand away from that binnacle. Surely your
w&rsquo;eel, my man. Yah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lit a cigar ostentatiously, and strolled into the waist
with his hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>In a surprisingly short time the captain reappeared;
he did not look at Herrick, but called Huish back and sat
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken stock&mdash;roughly.&rdquo; He
paused as if for somebody to help him out; and none doing
so, both gazing on him instead with manifest anxiety, he
yet more heavily resumed: &ldquo;Well, it won&rsquo;t fight. We
can&rsquo;t do it; that&rsquo;s the bed-rock. I&rsquo;m as sorry as what you
can be, and sorrier. But the game&rsquo;s up. We can&rsquo;t look
near Samoa. I don&rsquo;t know as we could get to Peru.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot-ju mean?&rdquo; asked Huish brutally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t &rsquo;most tell myself,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;I
drew it fine; I said I did; but what&rsquo;s been going on here
gets me! Appears as if the devil had been around. That
cook must be the holiest kind of fraud. Only twelve days
too! Seems like craziness. I&rsquo;ll own up square to one thing:
I seem to have figured too fine upon the flour. But the rest&mdash;my
land! I&rsquo;ll never understand it! There&rsquo;s been more
waste on this twopenny ship than what there is to an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
Atlantic Liner.&rdquo; He stole a glance at his companions:
nothing good was to be gleaned from their dark faces; and
he had recourse to rage. &ldquo;You wait till I interview that
cook!&rdquo; he roared, and smote the table with his fist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
interview the son of a gun so&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s never been spoken to
before. I&rsquo;ll put a bead upon the&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not lay a finger on the man,&rdquo; said Herrick.
&ldquo;The fault is yours, and you know it. If you turn a savage
loose in your storeroom, you know what to expect. I will
not allow the man to be molested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is hard to say how Davis might have taken this defiance;
but he was diverted to a fresh assailant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Huish, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a plummy captain,
ain&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re a blooming captain! Don&rsquo;t you set
up any of your chat to me, John Dyvis: I know you now;
you ain&rsquo;t any more use than a blooming dawl! O, you
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you? O, it &lsquo;gets you,&rsquo; do it? O, I
dessay! W&rsquo;y, weren&rsquo;t you &lsquo;owling for fresh tins every
blessed day? &rsquo;Ow often &rsquo;ave I &rsquo;eard you send the &rsquo;ole
bloomin&rsquo; dinner off and tell the man to chuck it in the swill-tub?
And breakfast? O, my crikey! breakfast for ten,
and you &rsquo;ollerin&rsquo; for more! And now you &lsquo;can&rsquo;t &rsquo;most tell&rsquo;!
Blow me if it ain&rsquo;t enough to make a man write an insultin&rsquo;
letter to Gawd! You dror it mild, John Dyvis: don&rsquo;t &rsquo;andle
me; I&rsquo;m dyngerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Davis sat like one bemused; it might even have been
doubted if he heard, but the voice of the clerk rang about
the cabin like that of a cormorant among the ledges of the
cliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do, Huish,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, so you tyke his part, do you? you stuck-up, sneerin&rsquo;
snob. Tyke it then. Come on, the pair of you. But as
for John Dyvis, let him look out! He struck me the first
night aboard, and I never took a blow yet but wot I gave as
good. Let him knuckle down on his marrow-bones and beg
my pardon. That&rsquo;s my last word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stand by the captain,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;That makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span>
us two to one, both good men; and the crew will all follow
me. I hope I shall die very soon; but I have not the least
objection to killing you before I go. I should prefer it so;
I should do it with no more remorse than winking. Take
care&mdash;take care&mdash;you little cad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The animosity with which these words were uttered was
so marked in itself, and so remarkable in the man who
uttered them, that Huish stared, and even the humiliated
Davis reared up his head and gazed at his defender. As for
Herrick, the successive agitations and disappointments of
the day had left him wholly reckless; he was conscious of a
pleasant glow, an agreeable excitement; his head seemed
empty, his eyeballs burned as he turned them, his throat
was dry as a biscuit; the least dangerous man by nature,
except in so far as the weak are always dangerous, at that
moment he was ready to slay or to be slain with equal
unconcern.</p>

<p>Here at least was the gage thrown down, and battle
offered; he who should speak next would bring the matter
to an issue there and then; all knew it to be so and hung
back; and for many seconds by the cabin clock the trio sat
motionless and silent.</p>

<p>Then came an interruption, welcome as the flowers in
May.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land ho!&rdquo; sang out a voice on deck. &ldquo;Land a weatha
bow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land!&rdquo; cried Davis, springing to his feet. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
this? There ain&rsquo;t no land here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as men may run from the chamber of a murdered
corpse, the three ran forth out of the house and left their
quarrel behind them undecided.</p>

<p>The sky shaded down at the sea-level to the white of
opals; the sea itself, insolently, inkily blue, drew all about
them the uncompromising wheel of the horizon. Search
it as they pleased, not even the practised eye of Captain
Davis could descry the smallest interruption. A few filmy
clouds were slowly melting overhead; and about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
schooner, as around the only point of interest, a tropic bird,
white as a snow-flake, hung, and circled, and displayed, as
it turned, the long vermilion feather of its tail. Save the
sea and the heaven, that was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who sang out land?&rdquo; asked Davis. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any
boy playing funny-dog with me, I&rsquo;ll teach him skylarking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Uncle Ned contentedly pointed to a part of the
horizon where a greenish, filmy iridescence could be discerned
floating like smoke on the pale heavens.</p>

<p>Davis applied his glass to it, and then looked at the
Kanaka. &ldquo;Call that land?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s more
than I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One time long ago,&rdquo; said Uncle Ned, &ldquo;I see Anaa
all-e-same that, four five hours befo&rsquo; we come up. Capena
he say sun go down, sun go up again; he say lagoon all-e-same
milla.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All-e-same <i>what</i>?&rdquo; asked Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Milla, sah,&rdquo; said Uncle Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, ah! mirror,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;I see; reflection from
the lagoon. Well, you know, it is just possible, though it&rsquo;s
strange I never heard of it. Here, let&rsquo;s look at the chart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went back to the cabin, and found the position of
the schooner well to windward of the archipelago in the
midst of a white field of paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! you see for yourselves,&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Herrick; &ldquo;I somehow
think there&rsquo;s something in it. I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing too,
captain: that&rsquo;s all right about the reflection; I heard it in
Papeete.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fetch up that Findlay, then!&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
try it all ways. An island wouldn&rsquo;t come amiss the way
we&rsquo;re fixed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bulky volume was handed up to him, broken-backed
as is the way with Findlay; and he turned to the place and
began to run over the text, muttering to himself and turning
over the pages with a wetted finger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; And he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
read aloud: &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>New Island</i>. According to M. Delille this
island, which from private interests would remain unknown,
lies, it is said, in lat. 12° 49&prime; 10&Prime; S., long. 133° 6&prime; W. In
addition to the position above given, Commander Matthews,
H.M.S. <i>Scorpion</i>, states that an island exists in lat. 12° 0&prime; S.,
long. 133° 16&prime; W. This must be the same, if such an island
exists, which is very doubtful, and totally disbelieved in by
South Sea traders.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather in the conditional mood,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s anything you please,&rdquo; cried Davis, &ldquo;only there it
is! That&rsquo;s our place, and don&rsquo;t you make any mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Which from private interests would remain unknown,&rsquo;&rdquo;
read Herrick, over his shoulder. &ldquo;What may
that mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It should mean pearls,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;A pearling
island the Government don&rsquo;t know about. That sounds
like real estate. Or suppose it don&rsquo;t mean anything. Suppose
it&rsquo;s just an island; I guess we could fill up with fish,
and cocoa-nuts, and native stuff, and carry out the Samoa
scheme hand over fist. How long did he say it was before
they raised Anaa? Five hours, I think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four or five,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>Davis stepped to the door. &ldquo;What breeze had you that
time you made Anaa, Uncle Ned?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Six or seven knots,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty or thirty-five miles,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;High time
we were shortening sail, then. If it is an island, we don&rsquo;t
want to be butting our head against it in the dark; and if it
isn&rsquo;t an island, we can get through it just as well by daylight.
Ready about!&rdquo; he roared.</p>

<p>And the schooner&rsquo;s head was laid for that elusive glimmer
in the sky, which began already to pale in lustre and diminish
in size, as the stain of breath vanishes from a window pane.
At the same time she was reefed close down.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>THE PEARL-FISHER</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">About</span> four in the morning, as the captain and Herrick sat
together on the rail, there arose from the midst of the night
in front of them the voice of breakers. Each sprang to
his feet and stared and listened. The sound was continuous,
like the passing of a train; no rise or fall could
be distinguished; minute by minute the ocean heaved with
an equal potency against the invisible isle; and as time
passed, and Herrick waited in vain for any vicissitude in
the volume of that roaring, a sense of the eternal weighed
upon his mind. To the expert eye the isle itself was to be
inferred from a certain string of blots along the starry
heaven. And the schooner was laid to and anxiously
observed till daylight.</p>

<p>There was little or no morning bank. A brightening
came in the east; then a wash of some ineffable, faint, nameless
hue between crimson and silver; and then coals of fire.
These glimmered a while on the sea-line, and seemed to
brighten and darken and spread out, and still the night
and the stars reigned undisturbed; it was as though a spark
should catch and glow and creep along the foot of some heavy
and almost incombustible wall-hanging, and the room itself
be scarce menaced. Yet a little after, and the whole east
glowed with gold and scarlet, and the hollow of heaven was
filled with the daylight.</p>

<p>The isle&mdash;the undiscovered, the scarce-believed in&mdash;now
lay before them and close aboard; and Herrick thought
that never in his dreams had he beheld anything more
strange and delicate. The beach was excellently white, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
continuous barrier of trees inimitably green; the land perhaps
ten feet high, the trees thirty more. Every here and
there, as the schooner coasted northward, the wood was
intermitted; and he could see clear over the inconsiderable
strip of land (as a man looks over a wall) to the lagoon
within&mdash;and clear over that again to where the far side of
the atoll prolonged its pencilling of trees against the morning
sky. He tortured himself to find analogies. The isle was
like the rim of a great vessel sunken in the waters; it was
like the embankment of an annular railway grown upon with
wood: so slender it seemed amidst the outrageous breakers,
so frail and pretty, he would scarce have wondered to see it
sink and disappear without a sound, and the waves close
smoothly over its descent.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the captain was in the four cross-trees, glass
in hand, his eyes in every quarter, spying for an entrance,
spying for signs of tenancy. But the isle continued to unfold
itself in joints, and to run out in indeterminate capes,
and still there was neither house nor man, nor the smoke of
fire. Here a multitude of sea-birds soared and twinkled,
and fished in the blue waters; and there, and for miles
together, the fringe of coco-palm and pandanus extended
desolate, and made desirable green bowers for nobody to
visit, and the silence of death was only broken by the
throbbing of the sea.</p>

<p>The airs were very light, their speed was small; the heat
intense. The decks were scorching underfoot, the sun
flamed overhead, brazen, out of a brazen sky; the pitch
bubbled in the seams, and the brains in the brain-pan. And
all the while the excitement of the three adventurers glowed
about their bones like a fever. They whispered, and
nodded, and pointed, and put mouth to ear, with a singular
instinct of secrecy, approaching that island underhand
like eavesdroppers and thieves; and even Davis from
the cross-trees gave his orders mostly by gestures. The
hands shared in this mute strain, like dogs, without comprehending
it; and through the roar of so many miles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
breakers, it was a silent ship that approached an empty
island.</p>

<p>At last they drew near to the break in that interminable
gangway. A spur of coral sand stood forth on the one hand;
on the other a high and thick tuft of trees cut off the view;
between was the mouth of the huge laver. Twice a day the
ocean crowded in that narrow entrance and was heaped between
these frail walls; twice a day, with the return of the
ebb, the mighty surplusage of water must struggle to escape.
The hour in which the <i>Farallone</i> came there was the hour
of the flood. The sea turned (as with the instinct of the
homing pigeon) for the vast receptacle, swept eddying
through the gates, was transmuted, as it did so, into a
wonder of watery and silken hues, and brimmed into the
inland sea beyond. The schooner looked up close-hauled,
and was caught and carried away by the influx like a toy.
She skimmed; she flew; a momentary shadow touched her
decks from the shoreside trees; the bottom of the channel
showed up for a moment and was in a moment gone; the
next, she floated on the bosom of the lagoon, and below, in
the transparent chamber of waters, a myriad of many-coloured
fishes were sporting, a myriad pale flowers of coral
diversified the floor.</p>

<p>Herrick stood transported. In the gratified lust of his
eye he forgot the past and the present; forgot that he was
menaced by a prison on the one hand and starvation on the
other; forgot that he was come to that island, desperately
foraging, clutching at expedients. A drove of fishes,
painted like the rainbow and billed like parrots, hovered
up in the shadow of the schooner, and passed clear of it,
and glinted in the submarine sun. They were beautiful,
like birds, and their silent passage impressed him like a strain
of song.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, to the eye of Davis in the cross-trees, the
lagoon continued to expand its empty waters, and the long
succession of the shoreside trees to be paid out like fishing-line
off a reel. And still there was no mark of habitation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
The schooner, immediately on entering, had been kept away
to the nor&rsquo;ard where the water seemed to be the most deep;
and she was now skimming past the tall grove of trees,
which stood on that side of the channel and denied further
view. Of the whole of the low shores of the island only this
bight remained to be revealed. And suddenly the curtain
was raised; they began to open out a haven, snugly elbowed
there, and beheld, with an astonishment beyond words, the
roofs of men.</p>

<p>The appearance, thus &ldquo;instantaneously disclosed&rdquo; to
those on the deck of the <i>Farallone</i>, was not that of a city,
rather of a substantial country farm with its attendant
hamlet: a long line of sheds and store-houses; apart, upon
the one side, a deep-verandah&rsquo;d dwelling-house; on the
other, perhaps a dozen native huts; a building with a belfry
and some rude offer at architectural features that might be
thought to mark it out for a chapel; on the beach in front
some heavy boats drawn up, and a pile of timber running
forth into the burning shallows of the lagoon. From a
flagstaff at the pierhead the red ensign of England was displayed.
Behind, about, and over, the same tall grove of
palms, which had masked the settlement in the beginning,
prolonged its roof of tumultuous green fans, and turned and
ruffled overhead, and sang its silver song all day in the wind.
The place had the indescribable but unmistakable appearance
of being in commission; yet there breathed from it a
sense of desertion that was almost poignant, no human
figure was to be observed going to and fro about the houses,
and there was no sound of human industry or enjoyment.
Only, on the top of the beach, and hard by the flagstaff, a
woman of exorbitant stature and as white as snow was
to be seen beckoning with uplifted arm. The second
glance identified her as a piece of naval sculpture, the
flgure-head of a ship that had long hovered and plunged
into so many running billows, and was now brought ashore
to be the ensign and presiding genius of that empty
town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span></p>

<p>The <i>Farallone</i> made a soldier&rsquo;s breeze of it; the wind,
besides, was stronger inside than without under the lee of
the land; and the stolen schooner opened out successive
objects with the swiftness of a panorama, so that the
adventurers stood speechless. The flag spoke for itself; it
was no frayed and weathered trophy that had beaten itself
to pieces on the post, flying over desolation; and to make
assurance stronger, there was to be descried in the deep
shade of the verandah a glitter of crystal and the fluttering
of white napery. If the figure-head at the pier-end, with its
perpetual gesture and its leprous whiteness, reigned alone
in that hamlet as it seemed to do, it would not have reigned
long. Men&rsquo;s hands had been busy, men&rsquo;s feet stirring there,
within the circuit of the clock. The <i>Farallones</i> were sure of
it; their eyes dug in the deep shadow of the palms for some
one hiding; if intensity of looking might have prevailed,
they would have pierced the walls of houses; and there
came to them, in these pregnant seconds, a sense of being
watched and played with, and of a blow impending, that was
hardly bearable.</p>

<p>The extreme point of palms they had just passed enclosed
a creek, which was thus hidden up to the last moment
from the eyes of those on board; and from this a boat put
suddenly and briskly out, and a voice hailed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Schooner ahoy!&rdquo; it cried. &ldquo;Stand in for the pier!
In two cables&rsquo; lengths you&rsquo;ll have twenty fathoms water
and good holding-ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boat was manned with a couple of brown oarsmen
in scanty kilts of blue. The speaker, who was steering,
wore white clothes, the full dress of the tropics; a wide hat
shaded his face; but it could be seen that he was of stalwart
size, and his voice sounded like a gentleman&rsquo;s. So much
could be made out. It was plain, besides, that the <i>Farallone</i>
had been descried some time before at sea, and the inhabitants
were prepared for its reception.</p>

<p>Mechanically the orders were obeyed, and the ship
berthed; and the three adventurers gathered aft beside the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
house and waited, with galloping pulses and a perfect
vacancy of mind, the coming of the stranger who might mean
so much to them. They had no plan, no story prepared;
there was no time to make one; they were caught red-handed
and must stand their chance. Yet this anxiety
was chequered with hope. The island being undeclared,
it was not possible the man could hold any office or be in a
position to demand their papers. And beyond that, if
there was any truth in Findlay, as it now seemed there
should be, he was the representative of the &ldquo;private
reasons,&rdquo; he must see their coming with a profound disappointment;
and perhaps (hope whispered) he would be
willing and able to purchase their silence.</p>

<p>The boat was by that time forging alongside, and they
were able at last to see what manner of man they had to do
with. He was a huge fellow, six feet four in height, and of a
build proportionately strong, but his sinews seemed to be
dissolved in a listlessness that was more than languor. It
was only the eye that corrected this impression; an eye of
an unusual mingled brilliancy and softness, sombre as coal
and with lights that outshone the topaz; an eye of unimpaired
health and virility; an eye that bid you beware of
the man&rsquo;s devastating anger. A complexion, naturally
dark, had been tanned in the island to a hue hardly distinguishable
from that of a Tahitian; only his manners and
movements, and the living force that dwelt in him, like fire
in flint, betrayed the European. He was dressed in white
drill, exquisitely made; his scarf and tie were of tender-coloured
silks; on the thwart beside him there leaned a
Winchester rifle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is the doctor on board?&rdquo; he cried as he came up.
&ldquo;Dr. Symonds, I mean? You never heard of him? Nor
yet of the <i>Trinity Hall</i>? Ah!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not look surprised, seemed rather to affect it in
politeness; but his eye rested on each of the three white
men in succession with a sudden weight of curiosity that
was almost savage. &ldquo;Ah, <i>then</i>!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
small mistake, no doubt, and I must ask you to what I am
indebted for this pleasure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was by this time on the deck, but he had the art to be
quite unapproachable; the friendliest vulgarian, three parts
drunk, would have known better than take liberties; and
not one of the adventurers so much as offered to shake
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Davis, &ldquo;I suppose you may call it an
accident. We had heard of your island, and read that
thing in the Directory about the <i>private reasons</i>, you see;
so when we saw the lagoon reflected in the sky, we put her
head for it at once, and so here we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ope we don&rsquo;t intrude!&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>The stranger looked at Huish with an air of faint surprise,
and looked pointedly away again. It was hard to be more
offensive in dumb show.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may suit me, your coming here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My
own schooner is overdue, and I may put something in your
way in the meantime. Are you open to a charter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess so,&rdquo; said Davis; &ldquo;it depends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Attwater,&rdquo; continued the stranger. &ldquo;You,
I presume, are the captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. I am the captain of this ship: Captain
Brown,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, see &rsquo;ere!&rdquo; said Huish; &ldquo;better begin fair!
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s skipper on deck right enough, but not below. Below,
we&rsquo;re all equal, all got a lay in the adventure; when it comes
to business I&rsquo;m as good as &rsquo;e; and what I say is, let&rsquo;s go
into the &rsquo;ouse and have a lush, and talk it over among pals.
We&rsquo;ve some prime fizz,&rdquo; he said, and winked.</p>

<p>The presence of the gentleman lighted up like a candle
the vulgarity of the clerk; and Herrick instinctively, as
one shields himself from pain, made haste to interrupt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Hay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since introductions are
going. We shall be very glad if you will step inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attwater leaned to him swiftly. &ldquo;University man?&rdquo;
said he.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Merton,&rdquo; said Herrick, and the next moment
blushed scarlet at his indiscretion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am of the other lot,&rdquo; said Attwater: &ldquo;Trinity Hall,
Cambridge. I called my schooner after the old shop.
Well! this is a queer place and company for us to meet in,
Mr. Hay,&rdquo; he pursued, with easy incivility to the others.
&ldquo;But do you bear out ... I beg this gentleman&rsquo;s pardon,
I really did not catch his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is &rsquo;Uish, sir,&rdquo; returned the clerk, and blushed
in turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Attwater. And then turning again to
Herrick, &ldquo;Do you bear out Mr. Whish&rsquo;s description of your
vintage? or was it only the unaffected poetry of his own
nature bubbling up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick was embarrassed; the silken brutality of their
visitor made him blush; that he should be accepted as an
equal, and the others thus pointedly ignored, pleased him
in spite of himself, and then ran through his veins in a recoil
of anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only California; it&rsquo;s
good enough, I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attwater seemed to make up his mind. &ldquo;Well, then,
I&rsquo;ll tell you what: you three gentlemen come ashore this
evening and bring a basket of wine with you; I&rsquo;ll try and
find the food,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And by the by, here is a question
I should have asked you when I came on board: have you
had small-pox?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Personally, no,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;But the schooner
had it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Deaths?&rdquo; from Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is a dreadful sickness,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ad you any deaths?&rdquo; asked Huish, &ldquo;&rsquo;ere on the
island?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-nine,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;Twenty-nine deaths
and thirty-one cases, out of thirty-three souls upon
the island.&mdash;That&rsquo;s a strange way to calculate, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
Hay, is it not? Souls! I never say it but it startles
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, so that&rsquo;s why everything&rsquo;s deserted?&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is why, Mr. Whish,&rdquo; said Attwater; &ldquo;that is
why the house is empty and the graveyard full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twenty-nine out of thirty-three!&rdquo; exclaimed Herrick.
&ldquo;Why, when it came to burying&mdash;or did you bother
burying?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scarcely,&rdquo; said Attwater; &ldquo;or there was one day at
least when we gave up. There were five of the dead that
morning, and thirteen of the dying, and no one able to go
about except the sexton and myself. We held a council of
war, took the ... empty bottles ... into the lagoon,
and ... buried them.&rdquo; He looked over his shoulder,
back at the bright water. &ldquo;Well, so you&rsquo;ll come to
dinner, then? Shall we say half-past six? So good of
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice, in uttering these conventional phrases, fell at
once into the false measure of society; and Herrick unconsciously
followed the example.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure we shall be very glad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At half-past
six? Thank you so very much.&rdquo;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For my voice has been tuned to the note of the gun</p>
<p class="i05">That startles the deep when the combat&rsquo;s begun,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">quoted Attwater, with a smile, which instantly gave way
to an air of funereal solemnity. &ldquo;I shall particularly expect
Mr. Whish,&rdquo; he continued.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Whish, I trust you understand
the invitation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you, my boy!&rdquo; replied the genial Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is right, then; and quite understood, is it not?&rdquo;
said Attwater. &ldquo;Mr. Whish and Captain Brown at six-thirty
without fault&mdash;and you, Hay, at four sharp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he called his boat.</p>

<p>During all this talk a load of thought or anxiety had
weighed upon the captain. There was no part for which
nature had so liberally endowed him as that of the genial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
ship-captain. But to-day he was silent and abstracted.
Those who knew him could see that he hearkened close to
every syllable, and seemed to ponder and try it in balances.
It would have been hard to say what look there was, cold,
attentive, and sinister, as of a man maturing plans, which
still brooded over the unconscious guest; it was here, it
was there, it was nowhere; it was now so little that Herrick
chid himself for an idle fancy; and anon it was so gross and
palpable that you could say every hair on the man&rsquo;s head
talked mischief.</p>

<p>He woke up now, as with a start. &ldquo;You were talking
of a charter,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was I?&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s talk of it no
more at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your own schooner is overdue, I understand?&rdquo; continued
the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You understand perfectly, Captain Brown,&rdquo; said
Attwater; &ldquo;thirty-three days overdue at noon to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She comes and goes, eh? plies between here and ...?&rdquo;
hinted the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly; every four months; three trips in the year,&rdquo;
said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go in her ever?&rdquo; asked Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; one stops here,&rdquo; said Attwater; &ldquo;one has plenty
to attend to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop here, do you?&rdquo; cried Davis. &ldquo;Say, how
long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long, O Lord,&rdquo; said Attwater, with perfect, stern
gravity. &ldquo;But it does not seem so,&rdquo; he added, with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I daresay not,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;No, I suppose not.
Not with all your gods about you, and in as snug a berth
as this. For it is a pretty snug berth,&rdquo; said he, with a
sweeping look.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spot, as you are good enough to indicate, is not
entirely intolerable,&rdquo; was the reply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Shell, I suppose?&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there was shell,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a considerable big beast of a lagoon, sir,&rdquo; said
the captain. &ldquo;Was there a&mdash;was the fishing&mdash;would you
call the fishing anyways <i>good</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I would call it anyways anything,&rdquo;
said Attwater, &ldquo;if you put it to me direct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were pearls, too?&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pearls too,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I give out!&rdquo; laughed Davis, and his laughter
rang cracked like a false piece. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not going
to tell, you&rsquo;re not going to tell, and there&rsquo;s an end
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There can be no reason why I should affect the least
degree of secrecy about my island,&rdquo; returned Attwater;
&ldquo;that came wholly to an end with your arrival; and I am
sure, at any rate, that gentlemen like you and Mr. Whish
I should have always been charmed to make perfectly at
home. The point on which we are now differing&mdash;if you
can call it a difference&mdash;is one of times and seasons. I have
some information which you think I might impart, and I
think not. Well, we&rsquo;ll see to-night! By-by, Whish!&rdquo;
He stepped into his boat and shoved off. &ldquo;All understood,
then?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The captain and Mr. Whish at six-thirty,
and you, Hay, at four precise. You understand
that, Hay? Mind, I take no denial. If you&rsquo;re not there
by the time named, there will be no banquet; no song, no
supper, Mr. Whish!&rdquo;</p>

<p>White birds whisked in the air above, a shoal of parti-coloured
fishes in the scarce denser medium below; between,
like Mahomet&rsquo;s coffin, the boat drew away briskly on the
surface, and its shadow followed it over the glittering floor
of the lagoon. Attwater looked steadily back over his
shoulders as he sat; he did not once remove his eyes from
the <i>Farallone</i> and the group on her quarter-deck beside the
house, till his boat ground upon the pier. Thence, with an
agile pace, he hurried ashore, and they saw his white clothes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
shining in the chequered dusk of the grove until the house
received him.</p>

<p>The captain, with a gesture and a speaking countenance,
called the adventurers into the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said to Herrick, when they were seated,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s one good job at least. He&rsquo;s taken to you in
earnest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should that be a good job?&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you&rsquo;ll see how it pans out presently,&rdquo; returned
Davis. &ldquo;You go ashore and stand in with him, that&rsquo;s all!
You&rsquo;ll get lots of pointers; you can find out what he has,
and what the charter is, and who&rsquo;s the fourth man&mdash;for
there&rsquo;s four of them, and we&rsquo;re only three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And suppose I do, what next?&rdquo; cried Herrick.
&ldquo;Answer me that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I will, Robert Herrick,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;But
first, let&rsquo;s see all clear. I guess you know,&rdquo; he said, with
imperious solemnity, &ldquo;I guess you know the bottom is out
of this <i>Farallone</i> speculation? I guess you know it&rsquo;s <i>right</i>
out? and if this old island hadn&rsquo;t been turned up right when
it did, I guess you know where you and I and Huish would
have been?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;No matter who&rsquo;s
to blame, I know it. And what next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter who&rsquo;s to blame, you know it, right enough,&rdquo;
said the captain, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m obliged to you for the reminder.
Now, here&rsquo;s this Attwater: what do you think of
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I am attracted and
repelled. He was insufferably rude to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, Huish?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>Huish sat cleaning a favourite briar-root; he scarce
looked up from that engrossing task. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ast me what
I think of him!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a day comin&rsquo;, I pray
Gawd, when I can tell it him myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huish means the same as what I do,&rdquo; said Davis.
&ldquo;When that man came stepping around, and saying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
&lsquo;Look here, I&rsquo;m Attwater&rsquo;&mdash;and you knew it was so, by
God!&mdash;I sized him right straight up. He&rsquo;s the real article,
I said, and I don&rsquo;t like it; here&rsquo;s the real, first-rate, copper-bottomed
aristocrat. &lsquo;<i>Aw! don&rsquo;t know ye, do I? God
damn ye, did God make ye?</i>&rsquo; No, that couldn&rsquo;t be nothing
but genuine; a man&rsquo;s got to be born to that; and notice!
smart as champagne and hard as nails; no kind of a fool;
no, <i>sir</i>! not a pound of him! Well, what&rsquo;s he here upon
this beastly island for? I said. <i>He&rsquo;s</i> not here collecting
eggs. He&rsquo;s a palace at home, and powdered flunkeys; and
if he don&rsquo;t stay there, you bet he knows the reason why!
Follow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes, I &rsquo;ear you,&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been doing good business here, then,&rdquo; continued
the captain. &ldquo;For ten years he&rsquo;s been doing a great business.
It&rsquo;s pearl and shell, of course; there couldn&rsquo;t be nothing
else in such a place, and no doubt the shell goes off
regularly by this <i>Trinity Hall</i>, and the money for it straight
into the bank, so that&rsquo;s no use to us. But what else is there?
Is there nothing else he would be likely to keep here? Is
there nothing else he would be bound to keep here? Yes,
sir; the pearls! First, because they&rsquo;re too valuable to trust
out of his hands. Second, because pearls want a lot of
handling and matching; and the man who sells his pearls
as they come in one here, one there, instead of hanging
back and holding up&mdash;well, that man&rsquo;s a fool, and it&rsquo;s not
Attwater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Likely,&rdquo; said Huish, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s w&rsquo;at it is; not proved,
but likely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s proved,&rdquo; said Davis bluntly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose it was?&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;Suppose that was
all so, and he had these pearls&mdash;a ten years&rsquo; collection of
them?&mdash;Suppose he had? There&rsquo;s my question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain drummed with his thick hands on the board
in front of him; he looked steadily in Herrick&rsquo;s face, and
Herrick as steadily looked upon the table and the pattering
fingers; there was a gentle oscillation of the anchored ship,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
and a big patch of sunlight travelled to and fro between the
one and the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear me!&rdquo; Herrick burst out suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you better hear me first,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;Hear
me and understand me. We&rsquo;ve got no use for that fellow,
whatever you may have. He&rsquo;s your kind, he&rsquo;s not ours;
he&rsquo;s took to you, and he&rsquo;s wiped his boots on me and Huish.
Save him if you can!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save him?&rdquo; repeated Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Save him, if you&rsquo;re able!&rdquo; reiterated Davis, with a
blow of his clenched fist. &ldquo;Go ashore, and talk him
smooth; and if you get him and his pearls aboard, I&rsquo;ll spare
him. If you don&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s going to be a funeral. Is that
so, Huish? does that suit you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a forgiving man,&rdquo; said Huish, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not
the sort to spoil business neither. Bring the bloke on board
and bring his pearls along with him, and you can have it
your own way; maroon him where you like,&mdash;I&rsquo;m agreeable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and if I can&rsquo;t?&rdquo; cried Herrick, while the sweat
streamed upon his face. &ldquo;You talk to me as if I was God
Almighty, to do this and that! But if I can&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;you better do your level
best, or you&rsquo;ll see sights!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;O crikey, yes!&rdquo; He looked
across at Herrick with a toothless smile that was shocking
in its savagery; and, his ear caught apparently by the trivial
expression he had used, broke into a piece of the chorus of
a comic song which he must have heard twenty years before
in London: meaningless gibberish that, in that hour and
place, seemed hateful as a blasphemy: &ldquo;Hikey, pikey,
crikey, fikey, chillingawallaba dory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain suffered him to finish; his face was unchanged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way things are, there&rsquo;s many a man that wouldn&rsquo;t
let you go ashore,&rdquo; he resumed. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not that kind.
I know you&rsquo;d never go back on me, Herrick! Or if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
choose to,&mdash;go, and do it, and be damned!&rdquo; he cried, and
rose abruptly from the table.</p>

<p>He walked out of the house; and as he reached the door
turned and called Huish, suddenly and violently, like the
barking of a dog. Huish followed, and Herrick remained
alone in the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, see here!&rdquo; whispered Davis. &ldquo;I know that
man. If you open your mouth to him again, you&rsquo;ll ruin all.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h5>BETTER ACQUAINTANCE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> boat was gone again, and already half-way to the
<i>Farallone</i>, before Herrick turned and went unwillingly up
the pier. From the crown of the beach, the figure-head confronted
him with what seemed irony, her helmeted head
tossed back, her formidable arm apparently hurling something,
whether shell or missile, in the direction of the
anchored schooner. She seemed a defiant deity from
the island, coming forth to its threshold with a rush as of
one about to fly, and perpetuated in that dashing attitude.
Herrick looked up at her, where she towered above him head
and shoulders, with singular feelings of curiosity and romance,
and suffered his mind to travel to and fro in her life-history.
So long she had been the blind conductress of a
ship among the waves; so long she had stood here idle in the
violent sun, that yet did not avail to blister her; and was
even this the end of so many adventures? he wondered, or
was more behind? And he could have found it in his heart
to regret that she was not a goddess, nor yet he a pagan,
that he might have bowed down before her in that hour of
difficulty.</p>

<p>When he now went forward, it was cool with the shadow
of many well-grown palms; draughts of the dying breeze
swung them together overhead; and on all sides, with a
swiftness beyond dragon-flies or swallows, the spots of sunshine
flitted, and hovered, and returned. Underfoot, the
sand was fairly solid and quite level, and Herrick&rsquo;s steps fell
there noiseless as in new-fallen snow. It bore the marks of
having been once weeded like a garden alley at home; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
the pestilence had done its work, and the weeds were returning.
The buildings of the settlement showed here and
there through the stems of the colonnade, fresh painted,
trim and dandy, and all silent as the grave. Only here and
there in the crypt, there was a rustle and scurry and some
crowing of poultry; and from behind the house with the
verandahs he saw smoke arise and heard the crackling of
a fire.</p>

<p>The stone houses were nearest him upon his right. The
first was locked; in the second he could dimly perceive,
through a window, a certain accumulation of pearl-shell
piled in the far end; the third, which stood gaping open on
the afternoon, seized on the mind of Herrick with its
multiplicity and disorder of romantic things. Therein were
cables, windlasses, and blocks of every size and capacity;
cabin-windows and ladders; rusty tanks, a companion
hutch; a binnacle with its brass mountings and its compass
idly pointing, in the confusion and dusk of that shed, to a
forgotten pole; ropes, anchors, harpoons: a blubber-dipper
of copper, green with years; a steering-wheel, a tool-chest
with the vessel&rsquo;s name upon the top, the <i>Asia</i>: a whole
curiosity-shop of sea-curios, gross and solid, heavy to lift,
ill to break, bound with brass and shod with iron. Two
wrecks at the least must have contributed to this random
heap of lumber; and as Herrick looked upon it, it seemed
to him as if the two ships&rsquo; companies were there on guard,
and he heard the tread of feet and whisperings, and saw with
the tail of his eye the commonplace ghosts of sailor men.</p>

<p>This was not merely the work of an aroused imagination,
but had something sensible to go upon; sounds of a stealthy
approach were no doubt audible; and while he still stood
staring at the lumber, the voice of his host sounded suddenly,
and with even more than the customary softness of enunciation,
from behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Junk,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;only old junk! And does Mr. Hay
find a parable?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find at least a strong impression,&rdquo; replied Herrick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
turning quickly, lest he might be able to catch, on the face
of the speaker, some commentary on the words.</p>

<p>Attwater stood in the doorway, which he almost wholly
filled; his hands stretched above his head and grasping the
architrave. He smiled when their eyes met, but the expression
was inscrutable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, a powerful impression. You are like me; nothing
so affecting as ships!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The ruins of an
empire would leave me frigid, when a bit of an old rail that
an old shellback leaned on in the middle watch, would bring
me up all standing. But come, let&rsquo;s see some more of the
island. It&rsquo;s all sand and coral and palm-trees; but there&rsquo;s
a kind of a quaintness in the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find it heavenly,&rdquo; said Herrick, breathing deep, with
head bared in the shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re new from sea,&rdquo; said Attwater.
&ldquo;I daresay, too, you can appreciate what one calls it. It&rsquo;s
a lovely name. It has a flavour, it has a colour, it has a ring
and fall to it; it&rsquo;s like its author&mdash;it&rsquo;s half Christian! Remember
your first view of the island, and how it&rsquo;s only
woods and woods and water; and suppose you had asked
somebody for the name, and he had answered&mdash;<i>nemorosa
Zacynthos</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Jam medio apparet fluctu!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Herrick. &ldquo;Ye
gods, yes, how good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it gets upon the chart, the skippers will make nice
work of it,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;But here, come and see the
diving-shed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He opened a door, and Herrick saw a large display of
apparatus neatly ordered: pumps and pipes, and the leaded
boots, and the huge snouted helmets shining in rows along
the wall; ten complete outfits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole eastern half of my lagoon is shallow, you
must understand,&rdquo; said Attwater; &ldquo;so we were able to get
in the dress to great advantage. It paid beyond belief,
and was a queer sight when they were at it, and these marine
monsters&rdquo;&mdash;tapping the nearest of the helmets&mdash;&ldquo;kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
appearing and reappearing in the midst of the lagoon.
Fond of parables?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes!&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I saw these machines come up dripping and go
down again, and come up dripping and go down again, and
all the while the fellow inside as dry as toast!&rdquo; said Attwater;
&ldquo;and I thought we all wanted a dress to go down into the
world in, and come up scatheless. What do you think the
name was?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Self-conceit,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I mean seriously!&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call it self-respect, then!&rdquo; corrected Herrick, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not Grace? Why not God&rsquo;s Grace, Hay?&rdquo;
asked Attwater. &ldquo;Why not the grace of your Maker and
Redeemer, He who died for you, He who upholds you, He
whom you daily crucify afresh? There is nothing here&rdquo;&mdash;striking
on his bosom,&mdash;&ldquo;nothing there&rdquo;&mdash;smiting the
wall,&mdash;&ldquo;and nothing there,&rdquo;&mdash;stamping&mdash;&ldquo;nothing but
God&rsquo;s Grace! We walk upon it, we breathe it; we live and
die by it; it makes the nails and axles of the universe; and
a puppy in pyjamas prefers self-conceit!&rdquo; The huge dark
man stood over against Herrick by the line of the divers&rsquo;
helmets, and seemed to swell and glow; and the next
moment the life had gone from him&mdash;&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t believe in God?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in your sense, I am afraid,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never argue with young atheists or habitual drunkards,&rdquo;
said Attwater flippantly.&mdash;&ldquo;Let us go across the
island to the outer beach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was but a little way, the greatest width of that island
scarce exceeding a furlong, and they walked gently. Herrick
was like one in a dream. He had come there with a
mind divided; come prepared to study that ambiguous and
sneering mask, drag out the essential man from underneath,
and act accordingly; decision being till then postponed.
Iron cruelty, an iron insensibility to the suffering of others,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
the uncompromising pursuit of his own interests, cold
culture, manners without humanity: these he had looked
for, these he still thought he saw. But to find the whole
machine thus glow with the reverberation of religious zeal
surprised him beyond words; and he laboured in vain, as
he walked, to piece together into any kind of whole his odds
and ends of knowledge&mdash;to adjust again into any kind of
focus with itself his picture of the man beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brought you here to the South Seas?&rdquo; he asked
presently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many things,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;Youth, curiosity,
romance, the love of the sea, and (it will surprise you to
hear) an interest in missions. That has a good deal declined,
which will surprise you less. They go the wrong way to
work; they are too parsonish, too much of the old wife, and
even the old apple-wife. <i>Clothes</i>, <i>clothes</i>, are their idea; but
clothes are not Christianity, any more than they are the
sun in heaven, or could take the place of it! They think a
parsonage with roses, and church bells, and nice old women
bobbing in the lanes, are part and parcel of religion. But
religion is a savage thing, like the universe it illuminates;
savage, cold, and bare, but infinitely strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you found this island by an accident?&rdquo; said
Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you did!&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;And since then I have
had a business, and a colony, and a mission of my own. I
was a man of the world before I was a Christian; I&rsquo;m a man
of the world still, and I made my mission pay. No good
ever came of coddling. A man has to stand up in God&rsquo;s
sight and work up to his weight avoirdupois: then I&rsquo;ll talk
to him, but not before. I gave these beggars what they
wanted: a judge in Israel, the bearer of the sword and
scourge; I was making a new people here; and behold, the
angel of the Lord smote them and they were not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the very uttering of the words, which were accompanied
by a gesture, they came forth out of the porch of
the palm wood by the margin of the sea and full in front of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
the sun, which was near setting. Before them the surf
broke slowly. All around, with an air of imperfect wooden
things inspired with wicked activity, the crabs trundled and
scuttled into holes. On the right, whither Attwater pointed
and abruptly turned, was the cemetery of the island, a field
of broken stones from the bigness of a child&rsquo;s hand to that
of his head, diversified by many mounds of the same material,
and walled by a rude rectangular enclosure. Nothing grew
there but a shrub or two with some white flowers; nothing
but the number of the mounds, and their disquieting shape,
indicated the presence of the dead.</p>

<p class="center1 f90">&ldquo;The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="noind">quoted Attwater, as he entered by the open gateway into
that unholy close. &ldquo;Coral to coral, pebbles to pebbles,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;this has been the main scene of my activity in
the South Pacific. Some were good, and some bad, and the
majority (of course and always) null. Here was a fellow,
now, that used to frisk like a dog; if you had called him he
came like an arrow from a bow; if you had not, and he came
unbidden, you should have seen the deprecating eye and the
little intricate dancing step. Well, his trouble is over now,
he has lain down with kings and councillors; the rest of his
acts, are they not written in the book of the chronicles?
That fellow was from Penrhyn; like all the Penrhyn islanders
he was ill to manage; heady, jealous, violent: the man with
the nose! He lies here quiet enough. And so they all lie.</p>

<p class="center1 f90">&lsquo;And darkness was the burier of the dead!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood, in the strong glow of the sunset, with bowed
head; his voice sounded now sweet and now bitter with the
varying sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You loved these people?&rdquo; cried Herrick, strangely
touched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;Dear no! Don&rsquo;t think me a
philanthropist. I dislike men, and hate women. If I
like the islanders at all, it is because you see them here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
plucked of their lendings, their dead birds and cocked hats,
their petticoats and coloured hose. Here was one I liked
though,&rdquo; and he set his foot upon a mound. &ldquo;He was a
fine savage fellow; he had a dark soul; yes, I liked this one.
I am fanciful,&rdquo; he added, looking hard at Herrick, &ldquo;and I
take fads. I like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick turned swiftly and looked far away to where the
clouds were beginning to troop together and amass themselves
round the obsequies of day. &ldquo;No one can like me,&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wrong there,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;as a man
usually is about himself. You are attractive, very attractive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not me,&rdquo; said Herrick; &ldquo;no one can like me.
If you knew how I despised myself&mdash;and why!&rdquo; His voice
rang out in the quiet graveyard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew that you despised yourself,&rdquo; said Attwater.
&ldquo;I saw the blood come into your face to-day when you
remembered Oxford. And I could have blushed for you
myself, to see a man, a gentleman, with these two vulgar
wolves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick faced him with a thrill. &ldquo;Wolves?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I said wolves, and vulgar wolves,&rdquo; said Attwater.
&ldquo;Do you know that to-day, when I came on board, I
trembled?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You concealed it well,&rdquo; stammered Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A habit of mine,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;But I was afraid,
for all that: I was afraid of the two wolves.&rdquo; He raised
his hand slowly. &ldquo;And now, Hay, you poor lost puppy,
what do you do with the two wolves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I do? I don&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; said Herrick.
&ldquo;There is nothing wrong; all is above-board; Captain
Brown is a good soul; he is a ... he is....&rdquo; The
phantom voice of Davis called in his ear: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s going
to be a funeral&rdquo;; and the sweat burst forth and streamed
on his brow. &ldquo;He is a family man,&rdquo; he resumed again,
swallowing; &ldquo;he has children at home and a wife.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And a very nice man?&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;And so is
Mr. Whish, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go so far as that,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;I do not
like Huish. And yet ... he has his merits too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, in short, take them for all in all, as good a ship&rsquo;s
company as one would ask?&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said Herrick, &ldquo;quite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So then we approach the other point of why you
despise yourself?&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we not all despise ourselves?&rdquo; cried Herrick.
&ldquo;Do not you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say I do. But do I?&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;One
thing I know at least: I never gave a cry like yours. Hay!
it came from a bad conscience! Ah, man, that poor diving-dress
of self-conceit is sadly tattered! To-day, if ye will
hear my voice. To-day, now, while the sun sets, and here
in this burying-place of brown innocents, fall on your knees
and cast your sins and sorrows on the Redeemer.
Hay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not Hay!&rdquo; interrupted the other, strangling. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
call me that! I mean.... For God&rsquo;s sake, can&rsquo;t you see
I&rsquo;m on the rack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see it, I know it, I put and keep you there; my
fingers are on the screws!&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;Please God,
I will bring a penitent this night before His throne. Come,
come to the mercy-seat! He waits to be gracious, man&mdash;waits
to be gracious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spread out his arms like a crucifix; his face shone
with the brightness of a seraph&rsquo;s; in his voice, as it rose to
the last word, the tears seemed ready.</p>

<p>Herrick made a vigorous call upon himself. &ldquo;Attwater,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you push me beyond bearing. What am I to do?
I do not believe. It is living truth to you: to me, upon my
conscience, only folk-lore. I do not believe there is any
form of words under heaven by which I can lift the burthen
from my shoulders. I must stagger on to the end with
the pack of my responsibility; I cannot shift it; do you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
suppose I would not if I thought I could? I cannot&mdash;cannot&mdash;cannot&mdash;and
let that suffice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rapture was all gone from Attwater&rsquo;s countenance;
the dark apostle had disappeared; and in his place there
stood an easy, sneering gentleman, who took off his hat and
bowed. It was pertly done, and the blood burned in
Herrick&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, shall we go back to the house?&rdquo; said Attwater.
&ldquo;Our guests will soon be due.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick stood his ground a moment with clenched fists
and teeth; and as he so stood, the fact of his errand there
slowly swung clear in front of him, like the moon out of
clouds. He had come to lure that man on board; he was
failing, even if it could be said that he had tried; he was sure
to fail now, and knew it, and knew it was better so. And
what was to be next?</p>

<p>With a groan he turned to follow his host, who was
standing with polite smile, and instantly and somewhat
obsequiously led the way in the now darkened colonnade of
palms. There they went in silence, the earth gave up
richly of her perfume, the air tasted warm and aromatic in
the nostrils; and from a great way forward in the wood,
the brightness of lights and fire marked out the house of
Attwater.</p>

<p>Herrick meanwhile resolved and resisted an immense
temptation to go up, to touch him on the arm and breathe
a word in his ear: &ldquo;Beware, they are going to murder you.&rdquo;
There would be one life saved; but what of the two others?
The three lives went up and down before him like buckets
in a well, or like the scales of balances. It had come to a
choice, and one that must be speedy. For certain invaluable
minutes, the wheels of life ran before him, and he could
still divert them with a touch to the one side or the other,
still choose who was to live and who was to die. He considered
the men. Attwater intrigued, puzzled, dazzled,
enchanted and revolted him; alive, he seemed but a doubtful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
good; and the thought of him lying dead was so unwelcome
that it pursued him, like a vision, with every
circumstance of colour and sound. Incessantly he had before
him the image of that great mass of man stricken down
in varying attitudes and with varying wounds; fallen prone,
fallen supine, fallen on his side; or clinging to a doorpost
with the changing face and the relaxing fingers of the death-agony.
He heard the click of the trigger, the thud of the
ball, the cry of the victim; he saw the blood flow. And this
building up of circumstance was like a consecration of the
man, till he seemed to walk in sacrificial fillets. Next he
considered Davis, with his thick-fingered, coarse-grained,
oat-bread commonness of nature, his indomitable valour
and mirth in the old days of their starvation, the endearing
blend of his faults and virtues, the sudden shining forth of a
tenderness that lay too deep for tears; his children, Ada and
her bowel complaint, and Ada&rsquo;s doll. No, death could not
be suffered to approach that head even in fancy; with a
general heat and a bracing of his muscles, it was borne in on
Herrick that Ada&rsquo;s father would find in him a son to the
death. And even Huish showed a little in that sacredness;
by the tacit adoption of daily life they were become brothers;
there was an implied bond of loyalty in their cohabitation
of the ship and their past miseries; to which Herrick must
be a little true or wholly dishonoured. Horror of sudden
death for horror of sudden death, there was here no hesitation
possible: it must be Attwater. And no sooner was the
thought formed (which was a sentence) than his whole mind
of man ran in a panic to the other side: and when he looked
within himself, he was aware only of turbulence and inarticulate
outcry.</p>

<p>In all this there was no thought of Robert Herrick. He
had complied with the ebb-tide in man&rsquo;s affairs, and the
tide had carried him away; he heard already the roaring
of the maelstrom that must hurry him under. And in his
bedevilled and dishonoured soul there was no thought of self.</p>

<p>For how long he walked silent by his companion Herrick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
had no guess. The clouds rolled suddenly away; the
orgasm was over; he found himself placid with the placidity
of despair; there returned to him the power of commonplace
speech; and he heard with surprise his own voice say:
&ldquo;What a lovely evening!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not?&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;Yes, the evenings here
would be very pleasant if one had anything to do. By day,
of course, one can shoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shoot?&rdquo; asked Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am what you would call a fine shot,&rdquo; said
Attwater. &ldquo;It is faith; I believe my balls will go true;
if I were to miss once, it would spoil me for nine months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never miss, then?&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless I mean to,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;But to miss
nicely is the art. There was an old king one knew in the
western islands, who used to empty a Winchester all round
a man, and stir his hair or nick a rag out of his clothes with
every ball except the last; and that went plump between
the eyes. It was pretty practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You could do that?&rdquo; asked Herrick, with a sudden
chill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I can do anything,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;You do
not understand: what must be, must.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were now come near to the back part of the house.
One of the men was engaged about the cooking-fire, which
burned with the clear, fierce, essential radiance of cocoa-nut
shells. A fragrance of strange meats was in the air. All
round in the verandahs lamps were lighted, so that the place
shone abroad in the dusk of the trees with many complicated
patterns of shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and wash your hands,&rdquo; said Attwater, and led
the way into a clean, matted room with a cot bed, a safe, a
shelf or two of books in a glazed case, and an iron washing-stand.
Presently he cried in the native, and there appeared
for a moment in the doorway a plump and pretty young
woman with a clean towel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried Herrick, who now saw for the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
time the fourth survivor of the pestilence, and was startled
by the recollection of the captain&rsquo;s orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Attwater, &ldquo;the whole colony lives about
the house, what&rsquo;s left of it. We are all afraid of devils, if
you please! and Taniera and she sleep in the front parlour,
and the other boy on the verandah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is pretty,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too pretty,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;That was why I had
her married. A man never knows when he may be inclined
to be a fool about women; so when we were left alone I had
the pair of them to the chapel and performed the ceremony.
She made a lot of fuss. I do not take at all the romantic
view of marriage,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that strikes you as a safeguard?&rdquo; asked Herrick
with amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I am a plain man and very literal. <i>Whom
God hath joined together</i> are the words, I fancy. So one
married them, and respects the marriage,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, I may look to make an excellent marriage
when I go home,&rdquo; began Attwater confidentially. &ldquo;I am
rich. This safe alone&rdquo;&mdash;laying his hand upon it&mdash;&ldquo;will be
a moderate fortune, when I have the time to place the pearls
upon the market. Here are ten years&rsquo; accumulation from
a lagoon, where I have had as many as ten divers going all
day long; and I went further than people usually do in these
waters, for I rotted a lot of shell and did splendidly. Would
you like to see them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This confirmation of the captain&rsquo;s guess hit Herrick hard,
and he contained himself with difficulty. &ldquo;No, thank you,
I think not,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I do not care for pearls. I am
very indifferent to all these....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gewgaws?&rdquo; suggested Attwater. &ldquo;And yet I believe
you ought to cast an eye on my collection, which is really
unique, and which&mdash;O! it is the case with all of us and everything
about us!&mdash;hangs by a hair. To-day it groweth up
and flourisheth; to-morrow it is cut down and cast into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
oven. To-day it is here and together in this safe; to-morrow&mdash;to-night!&mdash;it
may be scattered. Thou fool, this night thy
soul shall be required of thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not?&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to speak in riddles,&rdquo; said Herrick unsteadily.
&ldquo;I do not understand what manner of man you are, nor
what you are driving at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attwater stood with his hands upon his hips, and his
head bent forward. &ldquo;I am a fatalist,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and
just now (if you insist on it) an experimentalist. Talking
of which, by the by, who painted out the schooner&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
he said, with mocking softness, &ldquo;because, do you know?
one thinks it should be done again. It can still be partly
read; and whatever is worth doing is surely worth doing
well. You think with me? That is so nice! Well, shall
we step on the verandah? I have a dry sherry that I would
like your opinion of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick followed him forth to where, under the light of
the hanging lamps, the table shone with napery and crystal;
followed him as the criminal goes with the hangman, or the
sheep with the butcher; took the sherry mechanically,
drank it, and spoke mechanical words of praise. The object
of his terror had become suddenly inverted; till then he
had seen Attwater trussed and gagged, a helpless victim, and
had longed to run in and save him; he saw him now tower
up mysterious and menacing, the angel of the Lord&rsquo;s wrath,
armed with knowledge and threatening judgment. He set
down his glass again, and was surprised to see it empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go always armed?&rdquo; he said, and the next moment
could have plucked his tongue out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;I have been through a
mutiny here; that was one of my incidents of missionary
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And just then the sound of voices reached them, and
looking forth from the verandah they saw Huish and the
captain drawing near.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h5>THE DINNER PARTY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">They</span> sat down to an island dinner, remarkable for its
variety and excellence: turtle-soup and steak, fish, fowls, a
sucking-pig, a cocoa-nut salad, and sprouting cocoa-nut
roasted for dessert. Not a tin had been opened; and save
for the oil and vinegar in the salad, and some green spears
of onion which Attwater cultivated and plucked with his own
hand, not even the condiments were European. Sherry,
hock, and claret succeeded each other, and the <i>Farallone</i>
champagne brought up the rear with the dessert.</p>

<p>It was plain that, like so many of the extremely religious
in the days before teetotalism, Attwater had a dash of the
epicure. For such characters it is softening to eat well;
doubly so to have designed and had prepared an excellent
meal for others; and the manners of their host were agreeably
mollified in consequence. A cat of huge growth sat on
his shoulder purring, and occasionally, with a deft paw,
capturing a morsel in the air. To a cat he might be likened
himself, as he lolled at the head of his table, dealing out
attentions and innuendoes, and using the velvet and the claw
indifferently. And both Huish and the captain fell progressively
under the charm of his hospitable freedom.</p>

<p>Over the third guest the incidents of the dinner may be
said to have passed for long unheeded. Herrick accepted
all that was offered him, ate and drank without tasting,
and heard without comprehension. His mind was singly
occupied in contemplating the horror of the circumstances
in which he sat. What Attwater knew, what the captain
designed, from which side treachery was to be first expected,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
these were the ground of his thoughts. There were times
when he longed to throw down the table and flee into the
night. And even that was debarred him; to do anything,
to say anything, to move at all, were only to precipitate the
barbarous tragedy; and he sat spellbound, eating with
white lips. Two of his companions observed him narrowly,
Attwater with raking, sidelong glances that did not interrupt
his talk, the captain with a heavy and anxious consideration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say this sherry is a really prime article,&rdquo;
said Huish. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow much does it stand you in, if it&rsquo;s a fair
question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred and twelve shillings in London, and the
freight to Valparaiso, and on again,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;It
strikes one as really not a bad fluid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A &rsquo;undred and twelve!&rdquo; murmured the clerk, relishing
the wine and the figures in a common ecstasy: &ldquo;O my!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So glad you like it,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;Help yourself,
Mr. Whish, and keep the bottle by you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend&rsquo;s name is Huish and not Whish, sir,&rdquo; said
the captain, with a flush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, I am sure. Huish and not Whish;
certainly,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;I was about to say that I have
still eight dozen,&rdquo; he added, fixing the captain with his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight dozen what?&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sherry,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Eight dozen excellent
sherry. Why, it seems almost worth it in itself&mdash;to a man
fond of wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ambiguous words struck home to guilty consciences,
and Huish and the captain sat up in their places and regarded
him with a scare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Worth what?&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred and twelve shillings,&rdquo; replied Attwater.</p>

<p>The captain breathed hard for a moment. He reached
out far and wide to find any coherency in these remarks;
then, with a great effort, changed the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I allow we are about the first white men upon this
island, sir,&rdquo; said he.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span></p>

<p>Attwater followed him at once, and with entire gravity,
to the new ground. &ldquo;Myself and Dr. Symonds excepted,
I should say the only ones,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;And yet who
can tell? In the course of the ages some one may have
lived here, and we sometimes think that some one must.
The coco-palms grow all round the island, which is scarce
like nature&rsquo;s planting. We found besides, when we landed,
an unmistakable cairn upon the beach; use unknown; but
probably erected in the hope of gratifying some mumbo-jumbo
whose very name is forgotten, by some thick-witted
gentry whose very bones are lost. Then the island (witness
the Directory) has been twice reported; and since my
tenancy, we have had two wrecks, both derelict. The rest
is conjecture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Symonds is your partner, I guess?&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dear fellow, Symonds! How he would regret it, if
he knew you had been here!&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s on the <i>Trinity &rsquo;All</i>, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; asked Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if you could tell me where the <i>Trinity &rsquo;All</i> was,
you would confer a favour, Mr. Whish!&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose she has a native crew?&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since the secret has been kept ten years, one would
suppose she had,&rdquo; replied Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, see &rsquo;ere!&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;You have everythink
about you in no end style, and no mistake, but I tell
you it wouldn&rsquo;t do for me. Too much of &lsquo;the old rustic
bridge by the mill&rsquo;; too retired by &rsquo;alf. Give me the sound
of Bow Bells!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not think it was always so,&rdquo; replied Attwater.
&ldquo;This was once a busy shore, although now, hark! you can
hear the solitude. I find it stimulating. And talking of
the sound of bells, kindly follow a little experiment of mine
in silence.&rdquo; There was a silver bell at his right hand to call
the servants; he made them a sign to stand still, struck the
bell with force, and leaned eagerly forward. The note rose
clear and strong; it rang out clear and far into the night and
over the deserted island; it died into the distance until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
there only lingered in the porches of the ear a vibration that
was sound no longer. &ldquo;Empty houses, empty sea, solitary
beaches!&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;And yet God hears the bell!
And yet we sit in this verandah on a lighted stage with all
heaven for spectators! And you call that solitude?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There followed a bar of silence, during which the captain
sat mesmerised.</p>

<p>Then Attwater laughed softly. &ldquo;These are the diversions
of a lonely man,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;and possibly not in
good taste. One tells oneself these little fairy tales for company.
If there <i>should</i> happen to be anything in folk-lore,
Mr. Hay? But here comes the claret. One does not offer
you Lafitte, captain, because I believe it is all sold to the
railroad dining-cars in your great country; but this Brâne-Mouton
is of a good year, and Mr. Whish will give me news
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a queer idea of yours!&rdquo; cried the captain, bursting
with a sigh from the spell that had bound him. &ldquo;So
you mean to tell me now, that you sit here evenings and ring
up ... well, ring on the angels ... by yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a matter of historic fact, and since you put it
directly, one does not,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;Why ring a bell,
when there flows out from oneself and everything about
one a far more momentous silence? the least beat of my
heart and the least thought in my mind echoing into eternity
for ever and for ever and for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, look &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; said Huish, &ldquo;turn down the lights at
once, and the Band of &rsquo;Ope will oblige! This ain&rsquo;t a spiritual
séance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No folk-lore about Mr. Whish&mdash;I beg your pardon,
captain: Huish, not Whish, of course,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>As the boy was filling Huish&rsquo;s glass, the bottle escaped
from his hand and was shattered, and the wine spilt on the
verandah floor. Instant grimness as of death appeared
in the face of Attwater; he smote the bell imperiously, and
the two brown natives fell into the attitude of attention and
stood mute and trembling. There was just a moment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
silence and hard looks; then followed a few savage words
in the native; and, upon a gesture of dismissal, the service
proceeded as before.</p>

<p>None of the party had as yet observed upon the excellent
bearing of the two men. They were dark, undersized, and
well set up; stepped softly, waited deftly, brought on the
wines and dishes at a look, and their eyes attended studiously
on their master.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you get your labour from anyway?&rdquo; asked
Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, where not?&rdquo; answered Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much of a soft job, I suppose?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will tell me where getting labour is!&rdquo; said
Attwater, with a shrug. &ldquo;And of course, in our case, as
we could name no destination, we had to go far and wide
and do the best we could. We have gone as far west as the
Kingsmills and as far south as Rapa-iti. Pity Symonds
isn&rsquo;t here! He is full of yarns. That was his part, to
collect them. Then began mine, which was the educational.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean to run them?&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay! to run them,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; said Davis; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of my depth.
How was this? Do you mean to say you did it single-handed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One did it single-handed,&rdquo; said Attwater, &ldquo;because
there was nobody to help one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By God, but you must be a holy terror!&rdquo; cried the
captain, in a glow of admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One does one&rsquo;s best,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now!&rdquo; said Davis, &ldquo;I have seen a lot of driving
in my time, and been counted a good driver myself. I
fought my way, third mate, round the Cape Horn with a
push of packet-rats that would have turned the devil out
of hell and shut the door on him; and I tell you, this racket
of Mr. Attwater&rsquo;s takes the cake. In a ship, why, there
ain&rsquo;t nothing to it! You&rsquo;ve got the law with you, that&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
what does it. But put me down on this blame&rsquo; beach alone,
with nothing but a whip and a mouthful of bad words, and
ask me to ... no, <i>sir</i>! it&rsquo;s not good enough! I haven&rsquo;t
got the sand for that!&rdquo; cried Davis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the law behind,&rdquo;
he added; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the law does it, every time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The beak ain&rsquo;t as black as he&rsquo;s sometimes pynted,&rdquo;
observed Huish humorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, one got the law after a fashion,&rdquo; said Attwater.
&ldquo;One had to be a number of things. It was sometimes
rather a bore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should smile!&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;Rather lively, I
should think!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay we mean the same thing,&rdquo; said Attwater.
&ldquo;However, one way or another, one got it knocked into
their heads that they <i>must</i> work, and they <i>did</i> ... until
the Lord took them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ope you made &rsquo;em jump,&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When it was necessary, Mr. Whish, I made them
jump,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet you did,&rdquo; cried the captain. He was a good
deal flushed, but not so much with wine as admiration;
and his eyes drank in the huge proportions of the other with
delight. &ldquo;You bet you did, and you bet that I can see you
doing it! By God, you&rsquo;re a man, and you can say I said so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too good of you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;did you ever have crime here?&rdquo; asked
Herrick, breaking his silence with a pungent voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Attwater, &ldquo;we did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how did you handle that, sir?&rdquo; cried the eager
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, it was a queer case,&rdquo; replied Attwater.
&ldquo;It was a case that would have puzzled Solomon. Shall
I tell it you? yes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain rapturously accepted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; drawled Attwater, &ldquo;here is what it was. I
daresay you know two types of natives, which may be called
the obsequious and the sullen? Well, one had them, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
types themselves, detected in the fact; and one had them
together. Obsequiousness ran out of the first like wine out
of a bottle, sullenness congested in the second. Obsequiousness
was all smiles; he ran to catch your eye, he loved to
gabble; and he had about a dozen words of beach English,
and an eighth-of-an-inch veneer of Christianity. Sullens
was industrious; a big down-looking bee. When he was
spoken to, he answered with a black look and a shrug of one
shoulder, but the thing would be done. I don&rsquo;t give him to
you for a model of manners; there was nothing showy about
Sullens; but he was strong and steady, and ungraciously
obedient. Now Sullens got into trouble; no matter how;
the regulations of the place were broken, and he was punished
accordingly&mdash;without effect. So, the next day, and the
next, and the day after, till I began to be weary of the business,
and Sullens (I am afraid) particularly so. There came
a day when he was in fault again, for the&mdash;O perhaps the
thirtieth time; and he rolled a dull eye upon me, with a
spark in it, and appeared to speak. Now the regulations
of the place are formal upon one point: we allow no explanations;
none are received, none allowed to be offered.
So one stopped him instantly, but made a note of the circumstance.
The next day he was gone from the settlement.
There could be nothing more annoying; if the labour took
to running away, the fishery was wrecked. There are sixty
miles of this island, you see, all in length like the Queen&rsquo;s
highway; the idea of pursuit in such a place was a piece of
single-minded childishness, which one did not entertain.
Two days later, I made a discovery; it came in upon me
with a flash that Sullens had been unjustly punished from
beginning to end, and the real culprit throughout had been
Obsequiousness. The native who talks, like the woman
who hesitates, is lost. You set him talking and lying; and
he talks, and lies, and watches your face to see if he has
pleased you; till, at last, out comes the truth! It came out
of Obsequiousness in the regular course. I said nothing to
him; I dismissed him; and late as it was, for it was already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
night, set off to look for Sullens. I had not far to go: about
two hundred yards up the island the moon showed him to
me. He was hanging in a coco-palm&mdash;I&rsquo;m not botanist
enough to tell you how&mdash;but it&rsquo;s the way, in nine cases out
of ten, these natives commit suicide. His tongue was out,
poor devil, and the birds had got at him. I spare you details:
he was an ugly sight! I gave the business six good
hours of thinking in this verandah. My justice had been
made a fool of; I don&rsquo;t suppose that I was ever angrier.
Next day, I had the conch sounded and all hands out before
sunrise. One took one&rsquo;s gun, and led the way, with
Obsequiousness. He was very talkative; the beggar supposed
that all was right now he had confessed; in the old
schoolboy phrase he was plainly &lsquo;sucking up&rsquo; to me; full
of protestations of good-will and good behaviour; to which
one answered one really can&rsquo;t remember what. Presently
the tree came in sight, and the hanged man. They all burst
out lamenting for their comrade in the island way, and
Obsequiousness was the loudest of the mourners. He was
quite genuine; a noxious creature without any consciousness
of guilt. Well, presently&mdash;to make a long story short&mdash;one
told him to go up the tree. He stared a bit, looked at one
with a trouble in his eye, and had rather a sickly smile; but
went. He was obedient to the last; he had all the pretty
virtues, but the truth was not in him. So soon as he was
up he looked down, and there was the rifle covering him;
and at that he gave a whimper like a dog. You could hear
a pin drop; no more keening now. There they all crouched
upon the ground with bulging eyes; there was he in the tree-top,
the colour of lead; and between was the dead man,
dancing a bit in the air. He was obedient to the last, recited
his crime, recommended his soul to God. And
then....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attwater paused, and Herrick, who had been listening
attentively, made a convulsive movement which upset his
glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; said the breathless captain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Shot,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;They came to the ground
together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick sprang to his feet with a shriek and an insensate
gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a murder!&rdquo; he screamed, &ldquo;a cold-hearted,
bloody-minded murder! You monstrous being! Murderer
and hypocrite&mdash;murderer and hypocrite&mdash;murderer and
hypocrite&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he repeated, and his tongue stumbled among
the words.</p>

<p>The captain was by him in a moment. &ldquo;Herrick!&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;behave yourself! Here, don&rsquo;t be a blame&rsquo;
fool!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick struggled in his embrace like a frantic child,
and suddenly bowing his face in his hands, choked into
a sob, the first of many, which now convulsed his body
silently, and now jerked from him indescribable and
meaningless sounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend appears over-excited,&rdquo; remarked Attwater,
sitting unmoved but all alert at table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be the wine,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t
no drinking man, you see. I&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ll take him away.
A walk&rsquo;ll sober him up, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He led him without resistance out of the verandah and
into the night, in which they soon melted; but still for some
time, as they drew away, his comfortable voice was to be
heard soothing and remonstrating, and Herrick answering,
at intervals, with the mechanical noises of hysteria.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s like a bloomin&rsquo; poultry yard!&rdquo; observed Huish,
helping himself to wine (of which he spilled a good deal)
with gentlemanly ease. &ldquo;A man should learn to beyave at
table,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather bad form, is it not?&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;Well,
well, we are left <i>tête-à-tête</i>. A glass of wine with you, Mr.
Whish!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h5>THE OPEN DOOR</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> captain and Herrick meanwhile turned their back
upon the lights in Attwater&rsquo;s verandah, and took
a direction towards the pier and the beach of the
lagoon.</p>

<p>The isle, at this hour, with its smooth floor of sand,
the pillared roof overhead, and the prevalent illumination
of the lamps, wore an air of unreality, like a deserted
theatre or a public garden at midnight. A man looked
about him for the statues and tables. Not the least air
of wind was stirring among the palms, and the silence
was emphasised by the continuous clamour of the surf
from the seashore, as it might be of traffic in the next
street.</p>

<p>Still talking, still soothing him, the captain hurried his
patient on, brought him at last to the lagoon side, and leading
him down the beach, laved his head and face with the
tepid water. The paroxysm gradually subsided, the sobs
became less convulsive and then ceased; by an odd but not
quite unnatural conjunction, the captain&rsquo;s soothing current
of talk died away at the same time and by proportional steps,
and the pair remained sunk in silence. The lagoon broke
at their feet in petty wavelets, and with a sound as delicate
as a whisper; stars of all degrees looked down on their own
images in that vast mirror; and the more angry colour of
the <i>Farallone&rsquo;s</i> riding lamp burned in the middle distance.
For long they continued to gaze on the scene before them,
and hearken anxiously to the rustle and tinkle of that
miniature surf, or the more distant and loud reverberations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
from the outer coast. For long speech was denied them;
and when the words came at last, they came to both simultaneously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Herrick ...&rdquo; the captain was beginning.</p>

<p>But Herrick, turning swiftly towards his companion,
bent him down with the eager cry: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s up anchor,
captain, and to sea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where to, my son?&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Up anchor&rsquo;s
easy saying. But where to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To sea,&rdquo; responded Herrick. &ldquo;The sea&rsquo;s big enough!
To sea&mdash;away from this dreadful island and that, O! that
sinister man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, we&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;You brace up,
and we&rsquo;ll see about that. You&rsquo;re all run down, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
wrong with you; you&rsquo;re all nerves, like Jemimar; you&rsquo;ve
got to brace up good and be yourself again, and then we&rsquo;ll
talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To sea,&rdquo; reiterated Herrick, &ldquo;to sea to-night&mdash;now&mdash;this
moment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be, my son,&rdquo; replied the captain firmly. &ldquo;No
ship of mine puts to sea without provisions; you can take
that for settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to understand,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;The
whole thing is over, I tell you. There is nothing to do here,
when he knows all. That man there with the cat knows all;
can&rsquo;t you take it in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All what?&rdquo; asked the captain, visibly discomposed.
&ldquo;Why, he received us like a perfect gentleman and treated
us real handsome, until you began with your foolery&mdash;and
I must say I seen men shot for less, and nobody sorry!
What more do you expect anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick rocked to and fro upon the sand, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guying us,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;he was guying us&mdash;only guying
us; it&rsquo;s all we&rsquo;re good for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was one queer thing, to be sure,&rdquo; admitted the
captain, with a misgiving of the voice; &ldquo;that about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
sherry. Damned if I caught on to that. Say, Herrick,
you didn&rsquo;t give me away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O! give you away!&rdquo; repeated Herrick with weary,
querulous scorn. &ldquo;What was there to give away? We&rsquo;re
transparent; we&rsquo;ve got rascal branded on us: detected
rascal&mdash;detected rascal! Why, before he came on board,
there was the name painted out, and he saw the whole thing.
He made sure we would kill him there and then, and stood
guying you and Huish on the chance. He calls that being
frightened! Next he had me ashore; a fine time I had!
<i>The two wolves</i>, he calls you and Huish. <i>What is the puppy
doing with the two wolves?</i> he asked. He showed me his
pearls; he said they might be dispersed before morning,
and <i>all hung by a hair</i>&mdash;and smiled as he said it, such a smile!
O, it&rsquo;s no use, I tell you! He knows all, he sees through all;
we only make him laugh with our pretences&mdash;he looks at us
and laughs like God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a silence. Davis stood with contorted brows,
gazing into the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pearls?&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;He showed them
to you? He has them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t show them; I forgot: only the safe
they were in,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll never get
them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve two words to say to that,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he would have been so easy at table,
unless he was prepared?&rdquo; cried Herrick. &ldquo;The servants
were both armed. He was armed himself; he always is;
he told me. You will never deceive his vigilance. Davis,
I know it! It&rsquo;s all up, I tell you, and keep telling you and
proving it. All up; all up. There&rsquo;s nothing for it, there&rsquo;s
nothing to be done: all gone: life, honour, love. O my
God, my God, why was I born?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another pause followed upon this outburst.</p>

<p>The captain put his hands to his brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another thing!&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;Why did he tell
you all this? Seems like madness to me!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span></p>

<p>Herrick shook his head with gloomy iteration. &ldquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t understand if I were to tell you,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I can understand any blame&rsquo; thing that you
can tell me,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, he&rsquo;s a fatalist,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? a fatalist?&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s a fellow that believes a lot of things,&rdquo; said
Herrick; &ldquo;believes that his bullets go true; believes that
all falls out as God chooses, do as you like to prevent it;
and all that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I guess I believe right so myself,&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet I do!&rdquo; says Davis.</p>

<p>Herrick shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Well, you must be
a fool,&rdquo; said he, and he leaned his head upon his knees.</p>

<p>The captain stood biting his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing sure,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I must
get Huish out of that. <i>He&rsquo;s</i> not fit to hold his end up with
a man like you describe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he turned to go away. The words had been quite
simple; not so the tone; and the other was quick to
catch it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Davis!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;no! Don&rsquo;t do it. Spare <i>me</i>, and
don&rsquo;t do it&mdash;spare yourself, and leave it alone&mdash;for God&rsquo;s
sake, for your children&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice rose to a passionate shrillness; another
moment, and he might be overheard by their not distant
victim. But Davis turned on him with a savage oath and
gesture; and the miserable young man rolled over on his
face on the sand, and lay speechless and helpless.</p>

<p>The captain meanwhile set out rapidly for Attwater&rsquo;s
house. As he went, he considered with himself eagerly,
his thoughts racing. The man had understood, he had
mocked them from the beginning; he would teach him to
make a mockery of John Davis! Herrick thought him a
god; give him a second to aim in, and the god was overthrown.
He chuckled as he felt the butt of his revolver.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
It should be done now, as he went in. From behind? It
was difficult to get there. From across the table? No, the
captain preferred to shoot standing, so as you could be sure
to get your hand upon your gun. The best would be to
summon Huish, and when Attwater stood up and turned&mdash;ah,
then would be the moment. Wrapped in this ardent
prefiguration of events, the captain posted towards the
house with his head down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hands up! Halt!&rdquo; cried the voice of Attwater.</p>

<p>And the captain, before he knew what he was doing, had
obeyed. The surprise was complete and irremediable.
Coming on the top crest of his murderous intentions, he had
walked straight into an ambuscade, and now stood, with his
hands impotently lifted, staring at the verandah.</p>

<p>The party was now broken up. Attwater leaned on a
post, and kept Davis covered with a Winchester. One of
the servants was hard by with a second at the port arms,
leaning a little forward, round-eyed with eager expectancy.
In the open space at the head of the stair, Huish was partly
supported by the other native; his face wreathed in meaningless
smiles, his mind seemingly sunk in the contemplation
of an unlighted cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Attwater, &ldquo;you seem to me to be a very
twopenny pirate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain uttered a sound in his throat for which we
have no name; rage choked him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to give you Mr. Whish&mdash;or the wine-sop
that remains of him,&rdquo; continued Attwater. &ldquo;He talks a
great deal when he drinks, Captain Davis of the <i>Sea Ranger</i>.
But I have quite done with him&mdash;and return the article with
thanks. Now,&rdquo; he cried sharply; &ldquo;another false movement
like that, and your family will have to deplore the loss
of an invaluable parent; keep strictly still, Davis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attwater said a word in the native, his eye still undeviatingly
fixed on the captain; and the servant thrust
Huish smartly forward from the brink of the stair. With
an extraordinary simultaneous dispersion of his members,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
that gentleman bounded forth into space, struck the earth,
ricocheted, and brought up with his arms about a palm.
His mind was quite a stranger to these events; the expression
of anguish that deformed his countenance at the moment
of the leap was probably mechanical; and he suffered
these convulsions in silence; clung to the tree like an infant;
and seemed, by his dips, to suppose himself engaged in the
pastime of bobbing for apples. A more finely sympathetic
mind or a more observant eye might have remarked, a little
in front of him on the sand and still quite beyond reach, the
unlighted cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is your Whitechapel carrion!&rdquo; said Attwater.
&ldquo;And now you might very well ask me why I do not put a
period to you at once, as you deserve. I will tell you why,
Davis. It is because I have nothing to do with the <i>Sea
Ranger</i> and the people you drowned, or the <i>Farallone</i> and
the champagne that you stole. That is your account with
God; He keeps it, and He will settle it when the clock
strikes. In my own case, I have nothing to go on but suspicion,
and I do not kill on suspicion, not even vermin like
you. But understand: if ever I see any of you again, it is
another matter, and you shall eat a bullet. And now take
yourself off. March! and as you value what you call your
life, keep your hands up as you go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain remained as he was, his hands up, his mouth
open: mesmerised with fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;March!&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Davis turned and passed slowly away. But even
as he went, he was meditating a prompt, offensive return.
In the twinkling of an eye he had leaped behind a tree; and
was crouching there, pistol in hand, peering from either
side of his place of ambush with bared teeth; a serpent
already poised to strike. And already he was too late.
Attwater and his servants had disappeared; and only the
lamps shone on the deserted table and the bright sand about
the house, and threw into the night in all directions the
strong and tall shadows of the palms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span></p>

<p>Davis ground his teeth. Where were they gone, the
cowards? to what hole had they retreated beyond reach?
It was in vain he should try anything, he, single and with a
second-hand revolver, against three persons, armed with
Winchesters, and who did not show an ear out of any of the
apertures of that lighted and silent house? Some of them
might have already ducked below it from the rear, and be
drawing a bead upon him at that moment from the low-browed
crypt, the receptacle of empty bottles and broken
crockery. No, there was nothing to be done but to bring
away (if it were still possible) his shattered and demoralised
forces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huish,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S lose my ciga&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Huish, reaching vaguely forward.</p>

<p>The captain let out a rasping oath. &ldquo;Come right along
here,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S all righ&rsquo;. Sleep here &rsquo;th Atty-Attwa. Go boar&rsquo;
t&rsquo;morr&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied the festive one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t come, and come now, by the living God,
I&rsquo;ll shoot you!&rdquo; cried the captain.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the sense of these words in
any way penetrated to the mind of Huish; rather that, in a
fresh attempt upon the cigar, he overbalanced himself and
came flying erratically forward: a course which brought
him within reach of Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you walk straight,&rdquo; said the captain, clutching
him, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll know why not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S lose my ciga&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Huish.</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s contained fury blazed up for a moment.
He twisted Huish round, grasped him by the neck of the
coat, ran him in front of him to the pier-end, and flung him
savagely forward on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look for your cigar then, you swine!&rdquo; said he, and
blew his boat-call till the pea in it ceased to rattle.</p>

<p>An immediate activity responded on board the <i>Farallone</i>;
far-away voices, and soon the sound of oars, floated along
the surface of the lagoon; and at the same time, from nearer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
hand, Herrick aroused himself and strolled languidly up.
He bent over the insignificant figure of Huish, where it
grovelled, apparently insensible, at the base of the figure-head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s not dead,&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Attwater?&rdquo; asked Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you just shut your head!&rdquo; replied Davis. &ldquo;You
can do that, I fancy, and by God, I&rsquo;ll show you how! I&rsquo;ll
stand no more of your drivel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They waited accordingly in silence till the boat bumped
on the farthest piers; then raised Huish, head and heels,
carried him down the gangway, and flung him summarily
in the bottom. On the way out he was heard murmuring
of the loss of his cigar; and after he had been handed up the
side like baggage, and cast down in the alleyway to slumber,
his last audible expression was: &ldquo;Splen&rsquo;l fl&rsquo; Attwa&rsquo;!&rdquo;
This the expert construed into &ldquo;Splendid fellow, Attwater&rdquo;;
with so much innocence had this great spirit issued from
the adventures of the evening.</p>

<p>The captain went and walked in the waist with brief
irate turns; Herrick leaned his arms on the taffrail; the
crew had all turned in. The ship had a gentle, cradling
motion; at times a block piped like a bird. On shore,
through the colonnade of palm stems, Attwater&rsquo;s house was
to be seen shining steadily with many lamps. And there
was nothing else visible, whether in the heaven above or in
the lagoon below, but the stars and their reflections. It
might have been minutes, or it might have been hours, that
Herrick leaned there, looking in the glorified water and
drinking peace. &ldquo;A bath of stars,&rdquo; he was thinking; when
a hand was laid at last on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herrick,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been walking off my
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sharp jar passed through the young man, but he
neither answered nor so much as turned his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I spoke a little rough to you on shore,&rdquo; pursued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
the captain; &ldquo;the fact is, I was real mad; but now it&rsquo;s over,
and you and me have to turn to and think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will <i>not</i> think,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, old man!&rdquo; said Davis kindly; &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t fight,
you know! You&rsquo;ve got to brace up and help me get things
straight. You&rsquo;re not going back on a friend? That&rsquo;s not
like you, Herrick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes, it is,&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; said the captain, and paused as if quite
at a loss. &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you have a glass of
champagne. <i>I</i> won&rsquo;t touch it, so that&rsquo;ll show you if I&rsquo;m in
earnest. But it&rsquo;s just the pick-me-up for you; it&rsquo;ll put an
edge on you at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you leave me alone!&rdquo; said Herrick, and turned
away.</p>

<p>The captain caught him by the sleeve; and he shook
him off and turned on him, for the moment like a demoniac.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go to hell in your own way!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>And he turned away again, this time unchecked, and
stepped forward to where the boat rocked alongside and
ground occasionally against the schooner. He looked about
him. A corner of the house was interposed between the
captain and himself; all was well; no eye must see him in
that last act. He slid silently into the boat; thence,
silently, into the starry water. Instinctively he swam a
little; it would be time enough to stop by and by.</p>

<p>The shock of the immersion brightened his mind immediately.
The events of the ignoble day passed before
him in a frieze of pictures, and he thanked &ldquo;whatever Gods
there be&rdquo; for that open door of suicide. In such a little
while he would be done with it, the random business at an
end, the prodigal son come home. A very bright planet
shone before him and drew a trenchant wake along the
water. He took that for his line and followed it.</p>

<p>That was the last earthly thing that he should look upon;
that radiant speck, which he had soon magnified into a City
of Laputa, along whose terraces there walked men and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
women of awful and benignant features, who viewed him
with distant commiseration. These imaginary spectators
consoled him; he told himself their talk, one to another;
it was of himself and his sad destiny.</p>

<p>From such flights of fancy he was aroused by the growing
coldness of the water. Why should he delay? Here,
where he was now, let him drop the curtain, let him seek the
ineffable refuge, let him lie down with all races and generations
of men in the house of sleep. It was easy to say, easy
to do. To stop swimming: there was no mystery in that,
if he could do it. Could he? And he could not. He knew
it instantly. He was aware instantly of an opposition in his
members, unanimous and invincible, clinging to life with a
single and fixed resolve, finger by finger, sinew by sinew;
something that was at once he and not he&mdash;at once within
and without him; the shutting of some miniature valve in
his brain, which a single manly thought should suffice to
open&mdash;and the grasp of an external fate ineluctable as
gravity. To any man there may come at times a consciousness
that there blows, through all the articulations of his
body, the wind of a spirit not wholly his; that his mind
rebels; that another girds him and carries him whither he
would not. It came now to Herrick, with the authority of a
revelation. There was no escape possible. The open door
was closed in his recreant face. He must go back into the
world and amongst men without illusion. He must stagger
on to the end with the pack of his responsibility and his
disgrace, until a cold, a blow, a merciful chance ball, or the
more merciful hangman, should dismiss him from his infamy.
There were men who could commit suicide; there
were men who could not; and he was one who could not.</p>

<p>For perhaps a minute there raged in his mind the coil
of this discovery; then cheerless certitude followed; and,
with an incredible simplicity of submission to ascertained
fact, he turned round and struck out for shore. There was
a courage in this which he could not appreciate; the
ignobility of his cowardice wholly occupying him. A strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
current set against him like a wind in his face; he contended
with it heavily, wearily, without enthusiasm, but with substantial
advantage; marking his progress the while, without
pleasure, by the outline of the trees. Once he had a moment
of hope. He heard to the southward of him, towards
the centre of the lagoon, the wallowing of some great fish,
doubtless a shark, and paused for a little, treading water.
Might not this be the hangman? he thought. But the
wallowing died away; mere silence succeeded; and Herrick
pushed on again for the shore, raging as he went at his own
nature. Ay, he would wait for the shark; but if he had
heard him coming!... His smile was tragic. He could
have spat upon himself.</p>

<p>About three in the morning, chance, and the set of the
current, and the bias of his own right-handed body so decided
it between them that he came to shore upon the beach
in front of Attwater&rsquo;s. There he sat down, and looked forth
into a world without any of the lights of hope. The poor
diving-dress of self-conceit was sadly tattered! With the
fairy tale of suicide, of a refuge always open to him, he had
hitherto beguiled and supported himself in the trials of life;
and behold! that also was only a fairy tale, that also was
folk-lore. With the consequences of his acts he saw himself
implacably confronted for the duration of life: stretched
upon a cross, and nailed there with the iron bolts of his own
cowardice. He had no tears; he told himself no stories.
His disgust with himself was so complete, that even the
process of apologetic mythology had ceased. He was like a
man cast down from a pillar, and every bone broken. He lay
there, and admitted the facts, and did not attempt to rise.</p>

<p>Dawn began to break over the far side of the atoll, the
sky brightened, the clouds became dyed with gorgeous
colours, the shadows of the night lifted. And, suddenly,
Herrick was aware that the lagoon and the trees wore again
their daylight livery; and he saw, on board the <i>Farallone</i>,
Davis extinguishing the lantern, and smoke rising from the
galley.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span></p>

<p>Davis, without doubt, remarked and recognised the
figure on the beach; or perhaps hesitated to recognise it;
for after he had gazed a long while from under his hand,
he went into the house and fetched a glass. It was very
powerful; Herrick had often used it. With an instinct
of shame he hid his face in his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what brings you here, Mr. Herrick-Hay, or Mr.
Hay-Herrick?&rdquo; asked the voice of Attwater. &ldquo;Your back
view from my present position is remarkably fine, and I
would continue to present it. We can get on very nicely
as we are, and if you were to turn round, do you know? I
think it would be awkward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick slowly rose to his feet; his heart throbbed hard,
a hideous excitement shook him, but he was master of himself.
Slowly he turned and faced Attwater and the muzzle
of a pointed rifle. &ldquo;Why could I not do that last night?&rdquo;
he thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you fire?&rdquo; he said aloud, in a voice
that trembled.</p>

<p>Attwater slowly put his gun under his arm, then his
hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Herrick; and then, with a cry:
&ldquo;Can you do anything with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you armed?&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;I ask for the
form&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Armed? No!&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;O yes, I am, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he flung upon the beach a dripping pistol.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are wet,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am wet,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;Can you do anything
with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attwater read his face attentively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would depend a good deal upon what you are,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I am? A coward!&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is very little to be done with that,&rdquo; said Attwater.
&ldquo;And yet the description hardly strikes one as
exhaustive.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, what does it matter?&rdquo; cried Herrick. &ldquo;Here I
am. I am broken crockery; I am a burst drum; the whole
of my life is gone to water; I have nothing left that I believe
in, except my living horror of myself. Why do I come
to you? I don&rsquo;t know; you are cold, cruel, hateful; and
I hate you, or I think I hate you. But you are an honest
man, an honest gentleman. I put myself, helpless, in your
hands. What must I do? If I can&rsquo;t do anything, be merciful
and put a bullet through me; it&rsquo;s only a puppy
with a broken leg!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I were you, I would pick up that pistol, come up to
the house, and put on some dry clothes,&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you really mean it?&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;You know
they&mdash;we&mdash;they.... But you know all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know quite enough,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;Come up
to the house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the captain, from the deck of the <i>Farallone</i>, saw
the two men pass together under the shadow of the grove.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h5>DAVID AND GOLIATH</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Huish</span> had bundled himself up from the glare of the day&mdash;his
face to the house, his knees retracted. The frail bones
in the thin tropical raiment seemed scarce more considerable
than a fowl&rsquo;s; and Davis, sitting on the rail with his arm
about a stay, contemplated him with gloom, wondering
what manner of counsel that insignificant figure should
contain. For since Herrick had thrown him off and deserted
to the enemy, Huish, alone of mankind, remained to
him to be a helper and oracle.</p>

<p>He considered their position with a sinking heart. The
ship was a stolen ship; the stores, whether from initial carelessness
or ill administration during the voyage, were insufficient
to carry them to any port except back to Papeete;
and there retribution waited in the shape of a gendarme,
a judge with a queer-shaped hat, and the horror of distant
Noumea. Upon that side there was no glimmer of hope.
Here, at the island, the dragon was roused; Attwater with
his men and his Winchesters watched and patrolled the
house; let him who dare approach it. What else was then
left but to sit there, inactive, pacing the decks, until the
<i>Trinity Hall</i> arrived and they were cast into irons, or until
the food came to an end, and the pangs of famine succeeded?
For the <i>Trinity Hall</i> Davis was prepared; he would barricade
the house, and die there defending it, like a rat in a crevice.
But for the other? The cruise of the <i>Farallone</i>, into which
he had plunged, only a fortnight before, with such golden
expectations, could this be the nightmare end of it? The
ship rotting at anchor, the crew stumbling and dying in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
scuppers? It seemed as if any extreme of hazard were to
be preferred to so grisly a certainty; as if it would be better
to up-anchor after all, put to sea at a venture, and, perhaps,
perish at the hands of cannibals on one of the more obscure
Paumotus. His eye roved swiftly over sea and sky in quest
of any promise of wind, but the fountains of the Trade were
empty. Where it had run yesterday and for weeks before,
a roaring blue river charioting clouds, silence now reigned;
and the whole height of the atmosphere stood balanced.
On the endless ribbon of island that stretched out to either
hand of him its array of golden and green and silvery palms,
not the most volatile frond was to be seen stirring; they
drooped to their stable images in the lagoon like things
carved of metal, and already their long line began to reverberate
heat. There was no escape possible that day, none
probable on the morrow. And still the stores were running
out!</p>

<p>Then came over Davis, from deep down in the roots of
his being, or at least from far back among his memories
of childhood and innocence, a wave of superstition. This
run of ill-luck was something beyond natural; the chances
of the game were in themselves more various: it seemed as
if the devil must serve the pieces. The devil? He heard
again the clear note of Attwater&rsquo;s bell ringing abroad into
the night, and dying away. How if God...?</p>

<p>Briskly he averted his mind. Attwater: that was the
point. Attwater had food and a treasure of pearls; escape
made possible in the present, riches in the future. They
must come to grips with Attwater; the man must die. A
smoky heat went over his face, as he recalled the impotent
figure he had made last night, and the contemptuous speeches
he must bear in silence. Rage, shame, and the love of
life, all pointed the one way; and only invention halted:
how to reach him? had he strength enough? was there any
help in that misbegotten packet of bones against the house?</p>

<p>His eyes dwelled upon him with a strange avidity, as
though he would read into his soul; and presently the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
sleeper moved, stirred uneasily, turned suddenly round,
and threw him a blinking look. Davis maintained the same
dark stare, and Huish looked away again and sat up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, I&rsquo;ve an &rsquo;eadache on me!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I believe
I was a bit swipey last night. W&rsquo;ere&rsquo;s that cry-byby
&rsquo;Errick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gone,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ashore?&rdquo; cried Huish. &ldquo;O, I say! I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a gone too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would,&rdquo; replied Huish. &ldquo;I like Attwater. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s
all right; we got on like one o&rsquo;clock when you were gone.
And ain&rsquo;t his sherry in it, rather? It&rsquo;s like Spiers and
Pond&rsquo;s Amontillado! I wish I &rsquo;ad a drain of it now.&rdquo; He
sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll never get no more of it&mdash;that&rsquo;s one thing,&rdquo;
said Davis gravely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, wot&rsquo;s wrong with you, Dyvis? Coppers &rsquo;ot?
Well, look at <i>me</i>! <i>I</i> ain&rsquo;t grumpy,&rdquo; said Huish; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
as plyful as a canary-bird, I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Davis, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re playful; I own that; and
you were playful last night, I believe, and a damned fine
performance you made of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Allo!&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow&rsquo;s this? Wot performance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said the captain, getting slowly
off the rail.</p>

<p>And he did: at full length, with every wounding epithet
and absurd detail repeated and emphasised; he had his own
vanity and Huish&rsquo;s upon the grill, and roasted them; and
as he spoke he inflicted and endured agonies of humiliation.
It was a plain man&rsquo;s masterpiece of the sardonic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of it?&rdquo; said he, when he had done,
and looked down at Huish, flushed and serious, and yet
jeering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you wot it is,&rdquo; was the reply: &ldquo;you and me
cut a pretty dicky figure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Davis, &ldquo;a pretty measly figure, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
God! And, by God, I want to see that man at my
knees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow to get him there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Davis. &ldquo;How to get hold of him!
They&rsquo;re four to two; though there&rsquo;s only one man among
them to count, and that&rsquo;s Attwater. Get a bead on Attwater,
and the others would cut and run and sing out like
frightened poultry&mdash;and old man Herrick would come
round with his hat for a share of the pearls. No, <i>sir</i>! it&rsquo;s
how to get hold of Attwater! And we daren&rsquo;t even go
ashore; he would shoot us in the boat like dogs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you particular about having him dead or alive?&rdquo;
asked Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to see him dead,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; said Huish, &ldquo;then I believe I&rsquo;ll do a bit of
breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he turned into the house.</p>

<p>The captain doggedly followed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your idea, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you let me alone, will you?&rdquo; said Huish, opening a
bottle of champagne. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ear my idea soon enough.
Wyte till I pour some cham on my &rsquo;ot coppers.&rdquo; He drank
a glass off, and affected to listen. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ark!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;&rsquo;ear
it fizz. Like &rsquo;am frying, I declyre. &rsquo;Ave a glass, do, and
look sociable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said the captain, with emphasis; &ldquo;no, I will
not! there&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You p&rsquo;ys your money and you tykes your choice, my
little man,&rdquo; returned Huish. &ldquo;Seems rather a shyme to me
to spoil your breakfast for wot&rsquo;s really ancient &rsquo;istory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He finished three parts of a bottle of champagne, and
nibbled a corner of biscuit, with extreme deliberation; the
captain sitting opposite and champing the bit like an impatient
horse. Then Huish leaned his arms on the table
and looked Davis in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;en you&rsquo;re ready!&rdquo; said he.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, what&rsquo;s your idea?&rdquo; said Davis, with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fair play!&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trouble is that I&rsquo;ve got none,&rdquo; replied Davis; and
wandered for some time in aimless discussion of the difficulties
of their path, and useless explanations of his own fiasco.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About done?&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dry up right here,&rdquo; replied Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Huish, &ldquo;you give me your &rsquo;and
across the table, and say, &lsquo;Gawd strike me dead if I don&rsquo;t
back you up.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>His voice was hardly raised, yet it thrilled the hearer.
His face seemed the epitome of cunning, and the captain
recoiled from it as from a blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Luck,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;Substantial guarantee demanded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he continued to hold out his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the good of any such tomfoolery,&rdquo; said the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, though,&rdquo; returned Huish. &ldquo;Gimme your &rsquo;and
and say the words; then you&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ear my view of it. Don&rsquo;t,
and you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain went through the required form, breathing
short, and gazing on the clerk with anguish. What to fear
he knew not, yet he feared slavishly what was to fall from
the pale lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me &rsquo;alf a second,&rdquo; said Huish,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and fetch the byby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The baby?&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fragile. With care. This side up,&rdquo; replied the clerk
with a wink, as he disappeared.</p>

<p>He returned, smiling to himself, and carrying in his hand
a silk handkerchief. The long stupid wrinkles ran up
Davis&rsquo;s brow as he saw it. What should it contain? He
could think of nothing more recondite than a revolver.</p>

<p>Huish resumed his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are you man enough to take charge of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
&rsquo;Errick and the niggers? Because I&rsquo;ll take care of Hattwater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; cried Davis. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;You gimme time.
Wot&rsquo;s the first point? The first point is that we can&rsquo;t get
ashore, and I&rsquo;ll make you a present of that for a &rsquo;ard one.
But &rsquo;ow about a flag of truce? Would that do the trick,
d&rsquo;ye think? or would Attwater simply blyze aw&rsquo;y at us in
the bloomin&rsquo; boat like dawgs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Davis, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more do I,&rdquo; said Huish; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he would
either; and I&rsquo;m sure I &rsquo;ope he won&rsquo;t! So then you can call
us ashore. Next point is to get near the managin&rsquo; direction.
And for that I&rsquo;m going to &rsquo;ave you write a letter, in w&rsquo;ich you
s&rsquo;y you&rsquo;re ashymed to meet his eye, and that the bearer,
Mr. J. L. &rsquo;Uish, is empowered to represent you. Armed
with w&rsquo;ich seemin&rsquo;ly simple expedient, Mr. J. L. &rsquo;Uish will
proceed to business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused, like one who had finished, but still held Davis
with his eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, you&rsquo;re big,&rdquo; returned Huish; &ldquo;&rsquo;e knows
you &rsquo;ave a gun in your pocket, and anybody can see with
&rsquo;alf an eye that you ain&rsquo;t the man to &lsquo;esitate about usin&rsquo; it.
So it&rsquo;s no go with you, and never was; you&rsquo;re out of the
runnin&rsquo;, Dyvis. But he won&rsquo;t be afryde of me, I&rsquo;m such a
little &rsquo;un! I&rsquo;m unarmed&mdash;no kid about that&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll hold
my &rsquo;ands up right enough.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;If I can
manage to sneak up nearer to him as we talk,&rdquo; he resumed,
&ldquo;you look out and back me up smart. If I don&rsquo;t, we go
aw&rsquo;y again, and nothink to &rsquo;urt. See?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s face was contorted by the frenzied effort
to comprehend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see. What do
you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean to do for the beast!&rdquo; cried Huish, in a burst
of venomous triumph. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring the &lsquo;ulkin&rsquo; bully to grass.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
He&rsquo;s &rsquo;ad his larks out of me; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to &rsquo;ave my lark out
of &rsquo;im, and a good lark too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said the captain, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure you want to know?&rdquo; asked Huish.</p>

<p>Davis rose and took a turn in the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want to know,&rdquo; he said at last with an
effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;en your back&rsquo;s at the wall, you do the best you can,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; began the clerk. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;y that, because I &rsquo;appen
to know there&rsquo;s a prejudice against it; it&rsquo;s considered
vulgar, awf&rsquo;ly vulgar.&rdquo; He unrolled the handkerchief and
showed a four-ounce jar. &ldquo;This &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s vitriol, this is,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>The captain stared upon him with a whitening face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the stuff!&rdquo; he pursued, holding it up. &ldquo;This&rsquo;ll
burn to the bone; you&rsquo;ll see it smoke upon &rsquo;im like &rsquo;ell-fire!
One drop upon &rsquo;is bloomin&rsquo; heyesight, and I&rsquo;ll trouble you
for Attwater!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, by God!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, see &rsquo;ere, ducky,&rdquo; said Huish, &ldquo;this is my bean-feast,
I believe? I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; up to that man single-&rsquo;anded, I
am. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s about seven foot high, and I&rsquo;m five foot one.
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s a rifle in his &rsquo;and, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s on the look-out, &rsquo;e wasn&rsquo;t born
yesterday. This is Dyvid and Goliar, I tell you! If I&rsquo;d
ast you to walk up and face the music I could understand.
But I don&rsquo;t. I on&rsquo;y ast you to stand by and spifflicate the
niggers. It&rsquo;ll all come in quite natural; you&rsquo;ll see, else!
Fust thing, you know, you&rsquo;ll see him running round and
&rsquo;owling like a good &rsquo;un....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> a juggins!&rdquo; exclaimed Huish. &ldquo;What
did you want? You wanted to kill him, and tried to last
night. You wanted to kill the &rsquo;ole lot of them, and tried to,
and &rsquo;ere I show you &rsquo;ow; and because there&rsquo;s some medicine
in a bottle you kick up this fuss!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem
someways reasonable, only there it is.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the happlication of science, I suppose?&rdquo; sneered
Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rdquo; cried Davis, pacing the floor;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s there! I draw the line at it. I can&rsquo;t put a finger to
no such piggishness. It&rsquo;s too damned hateful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose it&rsquo;s all your fancy pynted it,&rdquo; said
Huish, &ldquo;w&rsquo;en you take a pistol and a bit o&rsquo; lead, and copse
a man&rsquo;s brains all over him? No accountin&rsquo; for tystes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not denying it,&rdquo; said Davis; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s something here,
inside of me. It&rsquo;s foolishness; I daresay it&rsquo;s dam foolishness.
I don&rsquo;t argue; I just draw the line. Isn&rsquo;t there no
other way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look for yourself,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t wedded to
this, if you think I am; I ain&rsquo;t ambitious; I don&rsquo;t make a
point of playin&rsquo; the lead; I offer to, that&rsquo;s all, and if you
can&rsquo;t show me better, by Gawd, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the risk!&rdquo; cried Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ast me straight, I should say it was a case of
seven to one, and no takers,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s my
look-out, ducky, and I&rsquo;m gyme. Look at me, Dyvis, there
ain&rsquo;t any shilly-shally about me. I&rsquo;m gyme, that&rsquo;s wot I
am: gyme all through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain looked at him. Huish sat there preening
his sinister vanity, glorying in his precedency in evil; and
the villainous courage and readiness of the creature shone
out of him like a candle from a lantern. Dismay and a kind
of respect seized hold on Davis in his own despite. Until
that moment he had seen the clerk always hanging back,
always listless, uninterested, and openly grumbling at a
word of anything to do; and now, by the touch of an enchanter&rsquo;s
wand, he beheld him sitting girt and resolved, and
his face radiant. He had raised the devil, he thought;
and asked who was to control him, and his spirits quailed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look as long as you like,&rdquo; Huish was going on. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t see any green in my eye! I ain&rsquo;t afryde of Attwater,
I ain&rsquo;t afryde of you, and I ain&rsquo;t afryde of words. You
want to kill people, that&rsquo;s wot <i>you</i> want; but you want to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
it in kid gloves, and it can&rsquo;t be done that w&rsquo;y. Murder ain&rsquo;t
genteel, it ain&rsquo;t easy, it ain&rsquo;t safe, and it tykes a man to do
it. &rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s the man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huish!&rdquo; began the captain with energy; and then
stopped, and remained staring at him with corrugated
brows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, hout with it!&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ave you anythink
else to put up? Is there any other chanst to try?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain held his peace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are then!&rdquo; said Huish, with a shrug.</p>

<p>Davis fell again to his pacing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you may do sentry-go till you&rsquo;re blue in the mug,
you won&rsquo;t find anythink else,&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>There was a little silence; the captain, like a man
launched on a swing, flying dizzily among extremes of conjecture
and refusal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But see,&rdquo; he said, suddenly pausing. &ldquo;Can you?
Can the thing be done? It&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I get within twenty foot of &rsquo;im it&rsquo;ll be done; so you
look out,&rdquo; said Huish, and his tone of certainty was absolute.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you know that?&rdquo; broke from the captain in
a choked cry. &ldquo;You beast, I believe you&rsquo;ve done it before!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s private affyres,&rdquo; returned Huish; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
a talking man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A shock of repulsion struck and shook the captain; a
scream rose almost to his lips; had he uttered it, he might
have cast himself at the same moment on the body of Huish,
might have picked him up, and flung him down, and wiped
the cabin with him, in a frenzy of cruelty that seemed half
moral. But the moment passed; and the abortive crisis
left the man weaker. The stakes were so high&mdash;the pearls
on the one hand&mdash;starvation and shame on the other. Ten
years of pearls! the imagination of Davis translated them
into a new, glorified existence for himself and his family.
The seat of this new life must be in London; there were
deadly reasons against Portland, Maine; and the pictures
that came to him were of English manners. He saw his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>
boys marching in the procession of a school, with gowns
on, an usher marshalling them and reading as he walked in
a great book. He was installed in a villa, semi-detached;
the name, &ldquo;Rosemore,&rdquo; on the gateposts. In a chair on
the gravel walk he seemed to sit smoking a cigar, a blue
ribbon in his buttonhole, victor over himself and circumstances
and the malignity of bankers. He saw the parlour,
with red curtains, and shells on the mantelpiece&mdash;and, with
the fine inconsistency of visions, mixed a grog at the
mahogany table ere he turned in. With that the <i>Farallone</i>
gave one of the aimless and nameless movements which
(even in an anchored ship, and even in the most profound
calm) remind one of the mobility of fluids; and he was back
again under the cover of the house, the fierce daylight besieging
it all round and glaring in the chinks, and the clerk
in a rather airy attitude, awaiting his decision.</p>

<p>He began to walk again. He aspired after the realisation
of these dreams, like a horse nickering for water; the
lust of them burned in his inside. And the only obstacle
was Attwater, who had insulted him from the first. He
gave Herrick a full share of the pearls, he insisted on it;
Huish opposed him, and he trod the opposition down; and
praised himself exceedingly. He was not going to use
vitriol himself; was he Huish&rsquo;s keeper? It was a pity he
had asked, but after all! ... he saw the boys again in the
school procession, with the gowns he had thought to be so
&ldquo;tony&rdquo; long since.... And at the same time the incomparable
shame of the last evening blazed up in his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have it your own way!&rdquo; he said hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I knew you would walk up,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;Now
for the letter. There&rsquo;s paper, pens, and ink. Sit down and
I&rsquo;ll dictyte.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain took a seat and the pen, looked a while
helplessly at the paper, then at Huish. The swing had
gone the other way; there was a blur upon his eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a dreadful business,&rdquo; he said, with a strong twitch of his
shoulders.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a start, no doubt,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;Tyke
a dip of ink. That&rsquo;s it. <i>William John Hattwater, Esq.
Sir:</i>&rdquo; he dictated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know his name is William John?&rdquo; asked
Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saw it on a packing-case,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;Got that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Davis. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s another thing. What
are we to write?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O my golly!&rdquo; cried the exasperated Huish. &ldquo;Wot
kind of man do <i>you</i> call yourself? <i>I&rsquo;m</i> goin&rsquo; to tell you wot
to write; that&rsquo;s <i>my</i> pitch; if you&rsquo;ll just be so bloomin&rsquo;
condescendin&rsquo; as to write it down! <i>William John Attwater,
Esq., Sir:</i>&rdquo; he reiterated. And, the captain at last beginning
half mechanically to move his pen, the dictation
proceeded: &ldquo;<i>It is with feelings of shyme and &rsquo;artfelt contrition
that I approach you after the yumiliatin&rsquo; events of last
night. Our Mr. &rsquo;Errick has left the ship, and will have doubtless
communicated to you the nature of our &rsquo;opes. Needless to
s&rsquo;y, these are no longer possible: Fate &rsquo;as declyred against us,
and we bow the &rsquo;ead. Well awyre as I am of the just suspicions
with w&rsquo;ich I am regarded, I do not venture to solicit
the fyvour of an interview for myself, but in order to put an end
to a situytion w&rsquo;ich must be equally pyneful to all, I &rsquo;ave deputed
my friend and partner, Mr. J. L. Huish, to l&rsquo;y before
you my proposals, and w&rsquo;ich by their moderytion, will, I trust,
be found to merit your attention. Mr. J. L. Huish is entirely
unarmed, I swear to Gawd! and will &rsquo;old &rsquo;is &rsquo;ands over &rsquo;is
&rsquo;ead from the moment he begins to approach you. I am your
fytheful servant, John Dyvis.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Huish read the letter with the innocent joy of amateurs,
chuckled gustfully to himself, and reopened it more than
once after it was folded, to repeat the pleasure, Davis meanwhile
sitting inert and heavily frowning.</p>

<p>Of a sudden he rose; he seemed all abroad. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;No! it can&rsquo;t be! It&rsquo;s too much; it&rsquo;s damnation.
God would never forgive it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and &rsquo;oo wants Him to?&rdquo; returned Huish, shrill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
with fury. &ldquo;You were damned years ago for the <i>Sea
Rynger</i>, and said so yourself. Well then, be damned for
something else, and &rsquo;old your tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain looked at him mistily. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he pleaded,
&ldquo;no, old man! don&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere now,&rdquo; said Huish, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you my ultimytum.
Go or st&rsquo;y w&rsquo;ere you are; I don&rsquo;t mind; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to see that
man and chuck this vitriol in his eyes. If you st&rsquo;y I&rsquo;ll go
alone; the niggers will likely knock me on the &rsquo;ead, and a
fat lot you&rsquo;ll be the better! But there&rsquo;s one thing sure:
I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ear no more of your moonin&rsquo; mullygrubbin&rsquo; rot, and
tyke it stryte.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain took it with a blink and a gulp. Memory,
with phantom voices, repeated in his ears something similar,
something he had once said to Herrick&mdash;years ago it seemed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, gimme over your pistol,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;I &rsquo;ave
to see all clear. Six shots, and mind you don&rsquo;t wyste them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain, like a man in a nightmare, laid down his
revolver on the table, and Huish wiped the cartridges and
oiled the works.</p>

<p>It was close on noon, there was no breath of wind, and
the heat was scarce bearable, when the two men came on
deck, had the boat manned, and passed down, one after
another, into the stern-sheets. A white shirt at the end of
an oar served as flag of truce; and the men, by direction,
and to give it the better chance to be observed, pulled with
extreme slowness. The isle shook before them like a place
incandescent; on the face of the lagoon blinding copper suns,
no bigger than sixpences, danced and stabbed them in the
eyeballs: there went up from sand and sea, and even from
the boat, a glare of scathing brightness; and as they could
only peer abroad from between closed lashes, the excess of
light seemed to be changed into a sinister darkness, comparable
to that of a thundercloud before it bursts.</p>

<p>The captain had come upon this errand for any one of a
dozen reasons, the last of which was desire for its success.
Superstition rules all men; semi-ignorant and gross natures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
like that of Davis, it rules utterly. For murder he had been
prepared; but this horror of the medicine in the bottle went
beyond him, and he seemed to himself to be parting the last
strands that united him to God. The boat carried him on
to reprobation, to damnation; and he suffered himself to be
carried passively consenting, silently bidding farewell to his
better self and his hopes.</p>

<p>Huish sat by his side in towering spirits that were not
wholly genuine. Perhaps as brave a man as ever lived, brave
as a weasel, he must still reassure himself with the tones
of his own voice; he must play his part to exaggeration, he
must out-Herod Herod, insult all that was respectable, and
brave all that was formidable, in a kind of desperate wager
with himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Golly, but it&rsquo;s &rsquo;ot!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Cruel &rsquo;ot, I call it.
Nice d&rsquo;y to get your gruel in! I s&rsquo;y, you know, it must feel
awf&rsquo;ly peculiar to get bowled over on a d&rsquo;y like this. I&rsquo;d
rather &rsquo;ave it on a cowld and frosty morning, wouldn&rsquo;t you?
(Singing) &lsquo;&rsquo;<i>Ere we go round the mulberry bush on a cowld and
frosty mornin&rsquo;.</i>&rsquo; (Spoken) Give you my word, I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t
thought o&rsquo; that in ten year; used to sing it at a hinfant
school in &rsquo;Ackney, &rsquo;Ackney Wick it was. (Singing) &lsquo;<i>This
is the way the tyler does, the tyler does.</i>&rsquo; (Spoken) Bloomin&rsquo;
&rsquo;umbug.&mdash;&rsquo;Ow are you off now, for the notion of a future
styte? Do you cotton to the tea-fight views, or the old
red-&rsquo;ot bogey business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, dry up!&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I want to know,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s within
the sp&rsquo;ere of practical politics for you and me, my boy;
we may both be bowled over, one up, t&rsquo;other down, within
the next ten minutes. It would be rather a lark, now, if
you only skipped across, came up smilin&rsquo; t&rsquo;other side, and
a hangel met you with a B. and S. under his wing. &rsquo;Ullo,
you&rsquo;d s&rsquo;y: come, I tyke this kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain groaned. While Huish was thus airing and
exercising his bravado, the man at his side was actually
engaged in prayer. Prayer, what for? God knows. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
out of his inconsistent, illogical, and agitated spirit, a stream
of supplication was poured forth, inarticulate as himself,
earnest as death and judgment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou Gawd seest me!&rdquo; continued Huish. &ldquo;I remember
I had that written in my Bible. I remember the
Bible too, all about Abinadab and parties.&mdash;Well, Gawd!&rdquo;
apostrophising the meridian, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to see a rum
start presently, I promise you that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain bounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have no blasphemy!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;no blasphemy
in my boat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, cap&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;Anythink to oblige.
Any other topic you would like to sudgest, the ryne-gyge,
the lightnin&rsquo;-rod, Shykespeare, or the musical glasses?
&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s conversation on tap. Put a penny in the slot, and ... &rsquo;ullo!
&rsquo;ere they are!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Now or never!
is &rsquo;e goin&rsquo; to shoot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the little man straightened himself into an
alert and dashing attitude, and looked steadily at the
enemy.</p>

<p>But the captain rose half up in the boat with eyes protruding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s wot?&rdquo; said Huish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those&mdash;blamed things,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>And indeed it was something strange. Herrick and
Attwater, both armed with Winchesters, had appeared out
of the grove behind the figure-head; and to either hand of
them, the sun glistened upon two metallic objects, locomotory
like men, and occupying in the economy of these
creatures the places of heads&mdash;only the heads were faceless.
To Davis, between wind and water, his mythology
appeared to have come alive and Tophet to be vomiting
demons. But Huish was not mystified a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Divers&rsquo; &rsquo;elmets, you ninny. Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they are,&rdquo; said Davis, with a gasp. &ldquo;And why?
O, I see, it&rsquo;s for armour.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Wot did I tell you?&rdquo; said Huish. &ldquo;Dyvid and
Goliar all the w&rsquo;y and back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two natives (for they it was that were equipped
in this unusual panoply of war) spread out to right and left,
and at last lay down in the shade, on the extreme flank of
the position. Even now that the mystery was explained,
Davis was hatefully preoccupied, stared at the flame on
their crests, and forgot, and then remembered with a smile,
the explanation.</p>

<p>Attwater withdrew again into the grove, and Herrick,
with his gun under his arm, came down the pier alone.</p>

<p>About halfway down he halted and hailed the boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell that to Mr. Attwater,&rdquo; replied Huish, stepping
briskly on the ladder. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tell it to you, because you
played the trucklin&rsquo; sneak. Here&rsquo;s a letter for him: tyke
it, and give it, and be &rsquo;anged to you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Davis, is this all right?&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>Davis raised his chin, glanced swiftly at Herrick and
away again, and held his peace. The glance was charged
with some deep emotion, but whether of hatred or of fear,
it was beyond Herrick to divine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give the letter.&rdquo; He drew a
score with his foot on the boards of the gangway. &ldquo;Till
I bring the answer, don&rsquo;t move a step past this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he returned to where Attwater leaned against a tree,
and gave him the letter. Attwater glanced it through.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo; he asked, passing it to
Herrick. &ldquo;Treachery?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I suppose so!&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, tell him to come on,&rdquo; said Attwater. &ldquo;One
isn&rsquo;t a fatalist for nothing. Tell him to come on and to
look out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herrick returned to the figure-head. Half-way down
the pier the clerk was waiting, with Davis by his side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to come along, Huish,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;He
bids you to look out&mdash;no tricks.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span></p>

<p>Huish walked briskly up the pier, and paused face to
face with the young man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;ere is &rsquo;e?&rdquo; said he, and to Herrick&rsquo;s surprise, the
low-bred, insignificant face before him flushed suddenly
crimson and went white again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right forward,&rdquo; said Herrick, pointing. &ldquo;Now, your
hands above your head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The clerk turned away from him and towards the figure-head,
as though he were about to address to it his devotions;
he was seen to heave a deep breath; and raised his arms.
In common with many men of his unhappy physical endowments,
Huish&rsquo;s hands were disproportionately long and
broad, and the palms in particular enormous; a four-ounce
jar was nothing in that capacious fist. The next moment
he was plodding steadily forward on his mission.</p>

<p>Herrick at first followed. Then a noise in his rear
startled him, and he turned about to find Davis already
advanced as far as the figure-head. He came, crouching
and open-mouthed, as the mesmerised may follow the
mesmeriser; all human considerations, and even the care
of his own life, swallowed up in one abominable and burning
curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried Herrick, covering him with his rifle.
&ldquo;Davis, what are you doing, man? You are not to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Davis instinctively paused, and regarded him with a
dreadful vacancy of eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put your back to that figure-head&mdash;do you hear me?&mdash;and
stand fast!&rdquo; said Herrick.</p>

<p>The captain fetched a breath, stepped back against the
figure-head, and instantly redirected his glances after Huish.</p>

<p>There was a hollow place of the sand in that part, and,
as it were, a glade among the coco-palms in which the direct
noonday sun blazed intolerably. At the far end, in the
shadow, the tall figure of Attwater was to be seen leaning on
a tree; towards him, with his hands over his head, and his
steps smothered in the sand, the clerk painfully waded.
The surrounding glare threw out and exaggerated the man&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>
smallness; it seemed no less perilous an enterprise, this that
he was gone upon, than for a whelp to besiege a citadel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, Mr. Whish. That will do,&rdquo; cried Attwater.
&ldquo;From that distance, and keeping your hands up, like a
good boy, you can very well put me in possession of the
skipper&rsquo;s views.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The interval betwixt them was perhaps forty feet; and
Huish measured it with his eye, and breathed a curse. He
was already distressed with labouring in the loose sand, and
his arms ached bitterly from their unnatural position. In
the palm of his right hand the jar was ready; and his heart
thrilled, and his voice choked, as he began to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hattwater,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if ever you
&rsquo;ad a mother....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can set your mind at rest: I had,&rdquo; returned Attwater;
&ldquo;and henceforth, if I may venture to suggest it,
her name need not recur in our communications. I
should perhaps tell you that I am not amenable to the
pathetic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, sir, if I &rsquo;ave seemed to tresparse on your
private feelin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said the clerk, cringing and stealing a step.
&ldquo;At least, sir, you will never pe&rsquo;suade me that you are not
a perfec&rsquo; gentleman; I know a gentleman when I see him;
and as such, I &rsquo;ave no &rsquo;esitation in throwin&rsquo; myself on your
merciful consideration. It <i>is</i> &rsquo;ard lines, no doubt; it&rsquo;s &rsquo;ard
lines to have to hown yourself beat; it&rsquo;s &rsquo;ard lines to &rsquo;ave
to come and beg to you for charity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When, if things had only gone right, the whole place
was as good as your own?&rdquo; suggested Attwater. &ldquo;I can
understand the feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are judging me, Mr. Attwater,&rdquo; said the clerk,
&ldquo;and God knows how unjustly! <i>Thou Gawd seest me</i>, was
the tex&rsquo; I &rsquo;ad in my Bible, w&rsquo;ich my father wrote it in with
&rsquo;is own &rsquo;and upon the fly-leaft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry I have to beg your pardon once more,&rdquo;
said Attwater; &ldquo;but, do you know, you seem to me to be
a trifle nearer, which is entirely outside of our bargain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
And I would venture to suggest that you take one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;steps
back; and stay there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The devil, at this staggering disappointment, looked
out of Huish&rsquo;s face, and Attwater was swift to suspect.
He frowned, he stared on the little man, and considered.
Why should he be creeping nearer? The next moment his
gun was at his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kindly oblige me by opening your hands. Open your
hands wide&mdash;let me see the fingers spread, you dog&mdash;throw
down that thing you&rsquo;re holding!&rdquo; he roared, his rage and
certitude increasing together.</p>

<p>And then, at almost the same moment, the indomitable
Huish decided to throw, and Attwater pulled a trigger.
There was scarce the difference of a second between the two
resolves, but it was in favour of the man with the rifle; and
the jar had not yet left the clerk&rsquo;s hand, before the ball
shattered both. For the twinkling of an eye the wretch
was in hell&rsquo;s agonies, bathed in liquid flames, a screaming
bedlamite; and then a second and more merciful bullet
stretched him dead.</p>

<p>The whole thing was come and gone in a breath. Before
Herrick could turn about, before Davis could complete his
cry of horror, the clerk lay in the sand, sprawling and convulsed.</p>

<p>Attwater ran to the body; he stooped and viewed it;
he put his finger in the vitriol, and his face whitened and
hardened with anger.</p>

<p>Davis had not yet moved; he stood astonished, with his
back to the figure-head, his hands clutching it behind him,
his body inclined forward from the waist.</p>

<p>Attwater turned deliberately and covered him with his
rifle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Davis,&rdquo; he cried, in a voice like a trumpet, &ldquo;I give you
sixty seconds to make your peace with God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Davis looked, and his mind awoke. He did not dream
of self-defence, he did not reach for his pistol. He drew
himself up instead to face death, with a quivering nostril.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll not trouble the Old Man,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;considering
the job I was on, I guess it&rsquo;s better business to just
shut my face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Attwater fired; there came a spasmodic movement of
the victim, and immediately above the middle of his forehead
a black hole marred the whiteness of the figure-head.
A dreadful pause; then again the report, and the solid
sound and jar of the bullet in the wood; and this time the
captain had felt the wind of it along his cheek. A third
shot, and he was bleeding from one ear; and along the
levelled rifle Attwater smiled like a red Indian.</p>

<p>The cruel game of which he was the puppet was now
clear to Davis; three times he had drunk of death, and he
must look to drink of it seven times more before he was
despatched. He held up his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steady!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your sixty seconds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Attwater.</p>

<p>The captain shut his eyes tight like a child: he held his
hands up at last with a tragic and ridiculous gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, look after my two kids,&rdquo; he
said; and then, after a pause and a falter, &ldquo;for Christ&rsquo;s
sake. Amen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he opened his eyes and looked down the rifle with a
quivering mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t keep fooling me long!&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all your prayer?&rdquo; asked Attwater, with a
singular ring in his voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess so,&rdquo; said Davis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; said Attwater, resting the butt of his rifle on the
ground, &ldquo;is that done? Is your peace made with Heaven?
Because it is with me. Go, and sin no more, sinful father.
And remember that whatever you do to others, God shall
visit it again a thousandfold upon your innocents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wretched Davis came staggering forward from his
place against the figure-head, fell upon his knees, and waved
his hands, and fainted.</p>

<p>When he came to himself again, his head was on Attwater&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
arm, and close by stood one of the men in diver&rsquo;s
helmets, holding a bucket of water, from which his late
executioner now laved his face. The memory of that dreadful
passage returned upon him in a clap; again he saw Huish
lying dead, again he seemed to himself to totter on the brink
of an unplumbed eternity. With trembling hands he seized
hold of the man whom he had come to slay; and his voice
broke from him like that of a child among the nightmares of
fever: &ldquo;O! isn&rsquo;t there no mercy? O! what must I do to
be saved?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought Attwater, &ldquo;here is the true penitent.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h5>A TAIL-PIECE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">On</span> a very bright, hot, lusty, strongly-blowing noon, a fortnight
after the events recorded, and a month since the
curtain rose upon this episode, a man might have been spied
praying on the sand by the lagoon beach. A point of palm-trees
isolated him from the settlement; and from the place
where he knelt, the only work of man&rsquo;s hand that interrupted
the expanse was the schooner <i>Farallone</i>, her berth quite
changed, and rocking at anchor some two miles to windward
in the midst of the lagoon. The noise of the Trade
ran very boisterous in all parts of the island; the nearer
palm-trees crashed and whistled in the gusts, those farther
off contributed a humming bass like the roar of cities; and
yet, to any man less absorbed, there must have risen at
times over this turmoil of the winds the sharper note of the
human voice from the settlement. There all was activity.
Attwater, stripped to his trousers, and lending a strong
hand of help, was directing and encouraging five Kanakas;
from his lively voice, and their more lively efforts, it was to
be gathered that some sudden and joyful emergency had
set them in this bustle; and the Union Jack floated once
more on its staff. But the suppliant on the beach, unconscious
of their voices, prayed on with instancy and
fervour, and the sound of his voice rose and fell again, and
his countenance brightened and was deformed with changing
moods of piety and terror.</p>

<p>Before his closed eyes the skiff had been for some time
tacking towards the distant and deserted <i>Farallone</i>; and
presently the figure of Herrick might have been observed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
board her, to pass for a while into the house, thence forward
to the forecastle, and at last to plunge into the main hatch.
In all these quarters his visit was followed by a coil of smoke;
and he had scarce entered his boat again and shoved off,
before flames broke forth upon the schooner. They burned
gaily; kerosene had not been spared, and the bellows of the
Trade incited the conflagration. About half-way on the
return voyage, when Herrick looked back, he beheld the
<i>Farallone</i> wrapped to the topmasts in leaping arms of fire,
and the voluminous smoke pursuing him along the face of
the lagoon. In one hour&rsquo;s time, he computed, the waters
would have closed over the stolen ship.</p>

<p>It so chanced that, as his boat flew before the wind with
much vivacity, and his eyes were continually busy in the
wake, measuring the progress of the flames, he found himself
embayed to the northward of the point of palms, and here
became aware at the same time of the figure of Davis immersed
in his devotion. An exclamation, part of annoyance,
part of amusement, broke from him: and he touched
the helm and ran the prow upon the beach not twenty feet
from the unconscious devotee. Taking the painter in his
hand, he landed, and drew near, and stood over him. And
still the voluble and incoherent stream of prayer continued
unabated. It was not possible for him to overhear the
suppliant&rsquo;s petitions, which he listened to some while in a
very mingled mood of humour and pity: and it was only
when his own name began to occur and to be conjoined with
epithets, that he at last laid his hand on the captain&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sorry to interrupt the exercise,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I want
you to look at the <i>Farallone</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain scrambled to his feet, and stood gasping
and staring. &ldquo;Mr. Herrick, don&rsquo;t startle a man like
that!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem someways rightly
myself since....&rdquo; He broke off. &ldquo;What did you
say anyway? O, the <i>Farallone</i>,&rdquo; and he looked languidly
out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Herrick. &ldquo;There she burns! and you may
guess from that what the news is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The <i>Trinity Hall</i>, I guess,&rdquo; said the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said Herrick; &ldquo;sighted half an hour ago,
and coming up hand over fist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it don&rsquo;t amount to a hill of beans,&rdquo; said the
captain, with a sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, come, that&rsquo;s rank ingratitude!&rdquo; cries Herrick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the captain meditatively, &ldquo;you mayn&rsquo;t
just see the way that I view it in, but I&rsquo;d &rsquo;most rather stay
here upon this island. I found peace here, peace in believing.
Yes, I guess this island is about good enough for John
Davis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard such nonsense!&rdquo; cried Herrick.
&ldquo;What! with all turning out in your favour the way it does,
the <i>Farallone</i> wiped out, the crew disposed of, a sure thing
for your wife and family, and you, yourself, Attwater&rsquo;s
spoiled darling and pet penitent!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Herrick, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; said the captain
gently; &ldquo;when you know he don&rsquo;t make no difference between
us. But, O! why not be one of us? why not come
to Jesus right away, and let&rsquo;s meet in yon beautiful land?
That&rsquo;s just the one thing wanted; just say, &lsquo;Lord, I believe,
help Thou mine unbelief!&rsquo; and He&rsquo;ll fold you in His arms.
You see, I know! I been a sinner myself!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>WEIR OF HERMISTON</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY</h3>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> the wild end of a moorland parish, far out of the sight of
any house, there stands a cairn among the heather, and a
little by east of it, in the going down of the braeside, a monument
with some verses half defaced. It was here that
Claverhouse shot with his own hand the Praying Weaver of
Balweary, and the chisel of Old Mortality has clinked on
that lonely gravestone. Public and domestic history have
thus marked with a bloody finger this hollow among the
hills; and since the Cameronian gave his life there, two
hundred years ago, in a glorious folly, and without comprehension
or regret, the silence of the moss has been broken
once again by the report of firearms and the cry of the dying.</p>

<p>The Deil&rsquo;s Hags was the old name. But the place is
now called Francie&rsquo;s Cairn. For a while it was told that
Francie walked. Aggie Hogg met him in the gloaming by
the cairnside, and he spoke to her, with chattering teeth, so
that his words were lost. He pursued Rob Todd (if any
one could have believed Robbie) for the space of half a mile
with pitiful entreaties. But the age is one of incredulity;
these superstitious decorations speedily fell off; and the
facts of the story itself, like the bones of a giant buried there
and half dug up, survived, naked and imperfect, in the
memory of the scattered neighbours. To this day, of winter
nights, when the sleet is on the window and the cattle are
quiet in the byre, there will be told again, amid the silence
of the young and the additions and corrections of the old,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
the tale of the Justice-Clerk and of his son, young Hermiston,
that vanished from men&rsquo;s knowledge; of the two Kirsties
and the four Black Brothers of the Cauldstaneslap; and of
Frank Innes, &ldquo;the young fool advocate,&rdquo; that came into
these moorland parts to find his destiny.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>LIFE AND DEATH OF MRS. WEIR</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> Lord Justice-Clerk was a stranger in that part of the
country; but his lady wife was known there from a child,
as her race had been before her. The old &ldquo;riding Rutherfords
of Hermiston,&rdquo; of whom she was the last descendant,
had been famous men of yore, ill neighbours, ill subjects,
and ill husbands to their wives, though not their properties.
Tales of them were rife for twenty miles about; and their
name was even printed in the page of our Scots histories,
not always to their credit. One bit the dust at Flodden;
one was hanged at his peel door by James the Fifth; another
fell dead in a carouse with Tom Dalyell; while a fourth (and
that was Jean&rsquo;s own father) died presiding at a Hell-Fire
Club, of which he was the founder. There were many heads
shaken in Crossmichael at that judgment; the more so as
the man had a villainous reputation among high and low,
and both with the godly and the worldly. At that very
hour of his demise he had ten going pleas before the Session,
eight of them oppressive. And the same doom extended
even to his agents; his grieve, that had been his right hand
in many a left-hand business, being cast from his horse one
night and drowned in a peat-hag on the Kye-skairs; and
his very doer (although lawyers have long spoons) surviving
him not long, and dying on a sudden in a bloody flux.</p>

<p>In all these generations, while a male Rutherford was in
the saddle with his lads, or brawling in a change-house,
there would be always a white-faced wife immured at home
in the old peel or the later mansion-house. It seemed this
succession of martyrs bided long, but took their vengeance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
in the end, and that was in the person of the last descendant,
Jean. She bore the name of the Rutherfords, but she was
the daughter of their trembling wives. At the first she
was not wholly without charm. Neighbours recalled in her, as
a child, a strain of elfin wilfulness, gentle little mutinies, sad
little gaieties, even a morning gleam of beauty that was not
to be fulfilled. She withered in the growing, and (whether
it was the sins of her sires or the sorrows of her mothers)
came to her maturity depressed, and, as it were, defaced;
no blood of life in her, no grasp or gaiety; pious, anxious,
tender, tearful, and incompetent.</p>

<p>It was a wonder to many that she had married&mdash;seeming
so wholly of the stuff that makes old maids. But chance
cast her in the path of Adam Weir, then the new Lord
Advocate, a recognised, risen man, the conqueror of many
obstacles, and thus late in the day beginning to think upon
a wife. He was one who looked rather to obedience than
beauty, yet it would seem he was struck with her at the first
look. &ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s she?&rdquo; he said, turning to his host; and,
when he had been told, &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;she looks menseful.
She minds me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;; and then, after a pause (which some
have been daring enough to set down to sentimental recollections),
&ldquo;Is she releegious?&rdquo; he asked, and was shortly
after, at his own request, presented. The acquaintance,
which it seems profane to call a courtship, was pursued with
Mr. Weir&rsquo;s accustomed industry, and was long a legend, or
rather a source of legends, in the Parliament House. He
was described coming, rosy with much port, into the drawing-room,
walking direct up to the lady, and assailing her
with pleasantries to which the embarrassed fair one responded,
in what seemed a kind of agony, &ldquo;Eh, Mr. Weir!&rdquo;
or &ldquo;O, Mr. Weir!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Keep me, Mr. Weir!&rdquo; On the
very eve of their engagement, it was related that one had
drawn near to the tender couple, and had overheard the
lady cry out, with the tones of one who talked for the sake
of talking, &ldquo;Keep me, Mr. Weir, and what became of him?&rdquo;
and the profound accents of the suitor reply, &ldquo;Haangit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
mem, haangit.&rdquo; The motives upon either side were much
debated. Mr. Weir must have supposed his bride to be
somewhat suitable; perhaps he belonged to that class of
men who think a weak head the ornament of women&mdash;an
opinion invariably punished in this life. Her descent and
her estate were beyond question. Her wayfaring ancestors
and her litigious father had done well by Jean. There was
ready money and there were broad acres, ready to fall wholly
to the husband, to lend dignity to his descendants, and to
himself a title, when he should be called upon the Bench.
On the side of Jean, there was perhaps some fascination of
curiosity as to this unknown male animal that approached
her with the roughness of a ploughman and the <i>aplomb</i> of
an advocate. Being so trenchantly opposed to all she knew,
loved, or understood, he may well have seemed to her the
extreme, if scarcely the ideal, of his sex. And besides, he
was an ill man to refuse. A little over forty at the period
of his marriage, he looked already older, and to the force of
manhood added the senatorial dignity of years; it was, perhaps,
with an unreverend awe, but he was awful. The Bench,
the Bar, and the most experienced and reluctant witness,
bowed to his authority&mdash;and why not Jeannie Rutherford?</p>

<p>The heresy about foolish women is always punished,
I have said, and Lord Hermiston began to pay the penalty
at once. His house in George Square was wretchedly ill-guided;
nothing answerable to the expense of maintenance
but the cellar, which was his own private care. When
things went wrong at dinner, as they continually did, my
lord would look up the table at his wife: &ldquo;I think these
broth would be better to sweem in than to sup.&rdquo; Or else
to the butler: &ldquo;Here, M&rsquo;Killop, awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; this Raadical gigot&mdash;tak&rsquo;
it to the French, man, and bring me some puddocks!
It seems rather a sore kind of business that I should be all
day in Court haanging Radicals, and get nawthing to my
denner.&rdquo; Of course this was but a manner of speaking,
and he had never hanged a man for being a Radical in his
life; the law, of which he was the faithful minister, directing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
otherwise. And of course these growls were in the nature
of pleasantry, but it was of a recondite sort; and uttered
as they were in his resounding voice, and commented
on by that expression which they called in the Parliament
House &ldquo;Hermiston&rsquo;s hanging face&rdquo;&mdash;they struck mere
dismay into the wife. She sat before him speechless and
fluttering; at each dish, as at a fresh ordeal, her eye hovered
toward my lord&rsquo;s countenance and fell again; if he but ate
in silence, unspeakable relief was her portion; if there were
complaint, the world was darkened. She would seek out
the cook, who was always her <i>sister in the Lord</i>. &ldquo;O, my
dear, this is the most dreidful thing that my lord can never
be contented in his own house!&rdquo; she would begin; and weep
and pray with the cook; and then the cook would pray with
Mrs. Weir; and the next day&rsquo;s meal would never be a penny
the better&mdash;and the next cook (when she came) would be
worse, if anything, but just as pious. It was often wondered
that Lord Hermiston bore it as he did; indeed, he was a
stoical old voluptuary, contented with sound wine and plenty
of it. But there were moments when he overflowed. Perhaps
half a dozen times in the history of his married life&mdash;&ldquo;Here!
tak&rsquo; it awa&rsquo;, and bring me a piece of bread and
kebbuck!&rdquo; he had exclaimed, with an appalling explosion
of his voice and rare gestures. None thought to dispute or
to make excuses; the service was arrested; Mrs. Weir sat at
the head of the table whimpering without disguise; and his
lordship opposite munched his bread and cheese in ostentatious
disregard. Once only Mrs. Weir had ventured to
appeal. He was passing her chair on his way into the study.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Edom!&rdquo; she wailed, in a voice tragic with tears,
and reaching out to him both hands, in one of which she
held a sopping pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>He paused and looked upon her with a face of wrath,
into which there stole, as he looked, a twinkle of humour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Noansense!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You and your noansense!
What do I want with a Christian faim&rsquo;ly? I want Christian
broth! Get me a lass that can plain-boil a potato, if she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
was a whüre off the streets.&rdquo; And with these words, which
echoed in her tender ears like blasphemy, he had passed on
to his study and shut the door behind him.</p>

<p>Such was the housewifery in George Square. It was
better at Hermiston, where Kirstie Elliott, the sister of a
neighbouring bonnet-laird, and an eighteenth cousin of the
lady&rsquo;s, bore the charge of all, and kept a trim house and a
good country table. Kirstie was a woman in a thousand,
clean, capable, notable; once a moorland Helen, and still
comely as a blood horse and healthy as the hill wind. High
in flesh and voice and colour, she ran the house with her
whole intemperate soul, in a bustle, not without buffets.
Scarce more pious than decency in those days required, she
was the cause of many an anxious thought and many a
tearful prayer to Mrs. Weir. Housekeeper and mistress
renewed the parts of Martha and Mary; and though with a
pricking conscience, Mary reposed on Martha&rsquo;s strength as
on a rock. Even Lord Hermiston held Kirstie in a particular
regard. There were few with whom he unbent so
gladly, few whom he favoured with so many pleasantries.
&ldquo;Kirstie and me maun have our joke,&rdquo; he would declare, in
high good-humour, as he buttered Kirstie&rsquo;s scones, and she
waited at table. A man who had no need either of love or
of popularity, a keen reader of men and of events, there was
perhaps only one truth for which he was quite unprepared:
he would have been quite unprepared to learn that Kirstie
hated him. He thought maid and master were well
matched; hard, handy, healthy, broad Scots folk, without
a hair of nonsense to the pair of them. And the fact was
that she made a goddess and an only child of the effete and
tearful lady; and even as she waited at table her hands
would sometimes itch for my lord&rsquo;s ears.</p>

<p>Thus, at least, when the family were at Hermiston, not
only my lord, but Mrs. Weir too, enjoyed a holiday. Free
from the dreadful looking-for of the miscarried dinner, she
would mind her seam, read her piety books, and take her
walk (which was my lord&rsquo;s orders), sometimes by herself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
sometimes with Archie, the only child of that scarce natural
union. The child was her next bond to life. Her frosted
sentiment bloomed again, she breathed deep of life, she let
loose her heart, in that society. The miracle of her motherhood
was ever new to her. The sight of the little man at
her skirt intoxicated her with the sense of power, and froze
her with the consciousness of her responsibility. She looked
forward, and, seeing him in fancy grow up and play his
diverse part on the world&rsquo;s theatre, caught in her breath
and lifted up her courage with a lively effort. It was only
with the child that she forgot herself and was at moments
natural; yet it was only with the child that she had conceived
and managed to pursue a scheme of conduct. Archie
was to be a great man and a good; a minister if possible, a
saint for certain. She tried to engage his mind upon her
favourite books, Rutherford&rsquo;s &ldquo;Letters,&rdquo; Scougal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grace
Abounding,&rdquo; and the like. It was a common practice of
hers (and strange to remember now) that she would carry
the child to the Deil&rsquo;s Hags, sit with him on the Praying
Weaver&rsquo;s Stone, and talk of the Covenanters till their tears
ran down. Her view of history was wholly artless, a design
in snow and ink; upon the one side, tender innocents with
psalms upon their lips; upon the other, the persecutors,
booted, bloody-minded, flushed with wine: a suffering
Christ, a raging Beelzebub. <i>Persecutor</i> was a word that
knocked upon the woman&rsquo;s heart; it was her highest
thought of wickedness, and the mark of it was on her house.
Her great-great-grandfather had drawn the sword against
the Lord&rsquo;s anointed on the field of Rullion Green, and
breathed his last (tradition said) in the arms of the detestable
Dalyell. Nor could she blind herself to this, that had
they lived in those old days, Hermiston himself would have
been numbered alongside of Bloody Mackenzie and the
politic Lauderdale and Rothes, in the band of God&rsquo;s immediate
enemies. The sense of this moved her to the more
fervour; she had a voice for that name of <i>persecutor</i> that
thrilled in the child&rsquo;s marrow; and when one day the mob
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
hooted and hissed them all in my lord&rsquo;s travelling carriage,
and cried, &ldquo;Down with the persecutor! down with Hanging
Hermiston!&rdquo; and mamma covered her eyes and wept, and
papa let down the glass and looked out upon the rabble
with his droll formidable face, bitter and smiling, as they
said he sometimes looked when he gave sentence, Archie
was for the moment too much amazed to be alarmed, but
he had scarce got his mother by herself before his shrill
voice was raised demanding an explanation: why had they
called papa a persecutor?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep me, my precious!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Keep
me, my dear! this is poleetical. Ye must never ask me
anything poleetical, Erchie. Your faither is a great man,
my dear, and it&rsquo;s no for me or you to be judging him. It
would be telling us all, if we behaved ourselves in our several
stations the way your faither does in his high office; and let
me hear no more of any such disrespectful and undutiful
questions! No that you meant to be undutiful, my lamb;
your mother kens that&mdash;she kens it well, dearie!&rdquo; And
so slid off to safer topics, and left on the mind of the child
an obscure but ineradicable sense of something wrong.</p>

<p>Mrs. Weir&rsquo;s philosophy of life was summed in one expression&mdash;tenderness.
In her view of the universe, which
was all lighted up with a glow out of the doors of hell, good
people must walk there in a kind of ecstasy of tenderness.
The beasts and plants had no souls; they were here but for
a day, and let their day pass gently! And as for the immortal
men, on what black, downward path were many of
them wending, and to what a horror of an immortality!
&ldquo;Are not two sparrows,&rdquo; &ldquo;Whosoever shall smite thee,&rdquo;
&ldquo;God sendeth His rain,&rdquo; &ldquo;Judge not, that ye be not
judged&rdquo;&mdash;these texts made her body of divinity; she put
them on in the morning with her clothes and lay down to
sleep with them at night; they haunted her like a favourite
air, they clung about her like a favourite perfume. Their
minister was a marrowy expounder of the law, and my lord
sat under him with relish; but Mrs. Weir respected him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
from far off; heard him (like the cannon of a beleaguered
city) usefully booming outside on the dogmatic ramparts;
and meanwhile, within and out of shot, dwelt in her private
garden which she watered with grateful tears. It seems
strange to say of this colourless and ineffectual woman, but
she was a true enthusiast, and might have made the sunshine
and the glory of a cloister. Perhaps none but Archie knew
she could be eloquent; perhaps none but he had seen her&mdash;her
colour raised, her hands clasped or quivering&mdash;glow
with gentle ardour. There is a corner of the policy of
Hermiston, where you come suddenly in view of the summit
of Black Fell, sometimes like the mere grass top of a hill,
sometimes (and this is her own expression) like a precious
jewel in the heavens. On such days, upon the sudden view
of it, her hand would tighten on the child&rsquo;s fingers, her voice
rise like a song. &ldquo;<i>I to the hills!</i>&rdquo; she would repeat. &ldquo;And
O, Erchie, arena these like the hills of Naphtali?&rdquo; and her
tears would flow.</p>

<p>Upon an impressionable child the effect of this continual
and pretty accompaniment to life was deep. The
woman&rsquo;s quietism and piety passed on to his different
nature undiminished; but whereas in her it was a native
sentiment, in him it was only an implanted dogma. Nature
and the child&rsquo;s pugnacity at times revolted. A cad from
the Potterrow once struck him in the mouth; he struck
back, the pair fought it out in the back stable lane towards
the Meadows, and Archie returned with a considerable
decline in the number of his front teeth, and unregenerately
boasting of the losses of the foe. It was a sore day for
Mrs. Weir; she wept and prayed over the infant backslider
until my lord was due from Court, and she must resume
that air of tremulous composure with which she always
greeted him. The judge was that day in an observant
mood, and remarked upon the absent teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid Erchie will have been fechting with some
of thae blagyard lads,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weir.</p>

<p>My lord&rsquo;s voice rang out as it did seldom in the privacy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
of his own house. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nonn of that, sir!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;Do you hear me?&mdash;nonn of that! No son of mine shall be
speldering in the glaur with any dirty raibble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The anxious mother was grateful for so much support;
she had even feared the contrary. And that night when
she put the child to bed&mdash;&ldquo;Now, my dear, ye see!&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;I told you what your faither would think of it, if
he heard ye had fallen into this dreidful sin; and let you
and me pray to God that ye may be keepit from the like
temptation or stren&rsquo;thened to resist it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The womanly falsity of this was thrown away. Ice and
iron cannot be welded; and the points of view of the
Justice-Clerk and Mrs. Weir were not less unassimilable.
The character and position of his father had long been a
stumbling-block to Archie, and with every year of his age
the difficulty grew more instant. The man was mostly
silent; when he spoke at all, it was to speak of the things
of the world, always in a worldly spirit, often in language
that the child had been schooled to think coarse, and sometimes
with words that he knew to be sins in themselves.
Tenderness was the first duty, and my lord was invariably
harsh. God was love; the name of my lord (to all who knew
him) was fear. In the world, as schematised for Archie by his
mother, the place was marked for such a creature. There
were some whom it was good to pity and well (though very
likely useless) to pray for; they were named reprobates,
goats, God&rsquo;s enemies, brands for the burning; and Archie
tallied every mark of identification, and drew the inevitable
private inference that the Lord Justice-Clerk was the chief
of sinners.</p>

<p>The mother&rsquo;s honesty was scarce complete. There was
one influence she feared for the child and still secretly combated;
that was my lord&rsquo;s; and half unconsciously, half in
a wilful blindness, she continued to undermine her husband
with his son. As long as Archie remained silent, she did so
ruthlessly, with a single eye to heaven and the child&rsquo;s salvation;
but the day came when Archie spoke. It was 1801,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
and Archie was seven, and beyond his years for curiosity
and logic, when he brought the case up openly. If judging
were sinful and forbidden, how came papa to be a judge?
to have that sin for a trade? to bear the name of it for a
distinction?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; said the little Rabbi, and wagged his
head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Weir abounded in commonplace replies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I canna see it,&rdquo; reiterated Archie. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell
you what, mamma, I don&rsquo;t think you and me&rsquo;s justifeed in
staying with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman awoke to remorse; she saw herself disloyal
to her man, her sovereign and bread-winner, in whom (with
what she had of worldliness) she took a certain subdued
pride. She expatiated in reply on my lord&rsquo;s honour and
greatness; his useful services in this world of sorrow and
wrong, and the place in which he stood, far above where
babes and innocents could hope to see or criticise. But she
had builded too well&mdash;Archie had his answers pat: Were
not babes and innocents the type of the kingdom of heaven?
Were not honour and greatness the badges of the world?
And at any rate, how about the mob that had once seethed
about the carriage?</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very fine,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;but in my opinion,
papa has no right to be it. And it seems that&rsquo;s not the
worst yet of it. It seems he&rsquo;s called &lsquo;the Hanging Judge&rsquo;&mdash;it
seems he&rsquo;s crooool. I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, mamma,
there&rsquo;s a tex&rsquo; borne in upon me: It were better for that
man if a milestone were bound upon his back and him
flung into the deepestmost pairts of the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O my lamb, ye must never say the like of that!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re to honour faither and mother, dear, that
your days may be long in the land. It&rsquo;s Atheists that cry
out against him&mdash;French Atheists, Erchie! Ye would never
surely even yourself down to be saying the same thing as
French Atheists? It would break my heart to think that
of you. And O, Erchie, here arena <i>you</i> setting up to <i>judge</i>?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
And have ye no forgot God&rsquo;s plain command&mdash;the First
with Promise, dear? Mind you upon the beam and the
mote!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having thus carried the war into the enemy&rsquo;s camp, the
terrified lady breathed again. And no doubt it is easy thus
to circumvent a child with catchwords, but it may be
questioned how far it is effectual. An instinct in his breast
detects the quibble, and a voice condemns it. He will
instantly submit, privately hold the same opinion. For
even in this simple and antique relation of the mother and
the child, hypocrisies are multiplied.</p>

<p>When the Court rose that year and the family returned
to Hermiston, it was a common remark in all the country
that the lady was sore failed. She seemed to lose and seize
again her touch with life, now sitting inert in a sort of durable
bewilderment, anon waking to feverish and weak activity.
She dawdled about the lasses at their work, looking stupidly
on; she fell to rummaging in old cabinets and presses, and
desisted when half through; she would begin remarks with
an air of animation and drop them without a struggle.
Her common appearance was of one who has forgotten
something and is trying to remember; and when she overhauled,
one after another, the worthless and touching
mementoes of her youth, she might have been seeking the
clue to that lost thought. During this period she gave
many gifts to the neighbours and house lasses, giving them
with a manner of regret that embarrassed the recipients.</p>

<p>The last night of all she was busy on some female work,
and toiled upon it with so manifest and painful a devotion
that my lord (who was not often curious) inquired as to its
nature.</p>

<p>She blushed to the eyes. &ldquo;O, Edom, it&rsquo;s for you!&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s slippers. I&mdash;I hae never made ye any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye daft auld wife!&rdquo; returned his lordship. &ldquo;A bonny
figure I would be, palmering about in bauchles!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day, at the hour of her walk, Kirstie interfered.
Kirstie took this decay of her mistress very hard; bore her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
a grudge, quarrelled with and railed upon her, the anxiety
of a genuine love wearing the disguise of temper. This day
of all days she insisted disrespectfully, with rustic fury, that
Mrs. Weir should stay at home. But, &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s my lord&rsquo;s orders,&rdquo; and set forth as usual. Archie was
visible in the acre bog, engaged upon some childish enterprise,
the instrument of which was mire; and she stood and
looked at him a while like one about to call; then thought
otherwise, sighed, and shook her head, and proceeded on
her rounds alone. The house lasses were at the burn-side
washing, and saw her pass with her loose, weary, dowdy
gait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a terrible feckless wife the mistress!&rdquo; said the
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;the wumman&rsquo;s seeck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, I canna see nae differ in her,&rdquo; returned the first.
&ldquo;A füshionless quean, a feckless carline.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor creature thus discussed rambled a while in the
grounds without a purpose. Tides in her mind ebbed and
flowed, and carried her to and fro like seaweed. She tried
a path, paused, returned, and tried another; questing, forgetting
her quest; the spirit of choice extinct in her bosom,
or devoid of sequency. On a sudden, it appeared as though
she had remembered, or had formed a resolution, wheeled
about, returned with hurried steps, and appeared in the
dining-room, where Kirstie was at the cleaning, like one
charged with an important errand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kirstie!&rdquo; she began, and paused; and then with conviction,
&ldquo;Mr. Weir isna speeritually minded, but he has
been a good man to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was perhaps the first time since her husband&rsquo;s elevation
that she had forgotten the handle to his name, of which the
tender, inconsistent woman was not a little proud. And
when Kirstie looked up at the speaker&rsquo;s face, she was aware
of a change.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Godsake, what&rsquo;s the maitter wi&rsquo; ye, mem?&rdquo; cried the
housekeeper, starting from the rug.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not ken,&rdquo; answered her mistress, shaking her head.
&ldquo;But he is not speeritually minded, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, sit down with ye! Godsake, what ails the wife?&rdquo;
cried Kirstie, and helped and forced her into my lord&rsquo;s own
chair by the cheek of the hearth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep me, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Kirstie, what&rsquo;s
this? I&rsquo;m frich&rsquo;ened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were her last words.</p>

<p>It was the lowering nightfall when my lord returned.
He had the sunset in his back, all clouds and glory; and
before him, by the wayside, spied Kirstie Elliott waiting.
She was dissolved in tears, and addressed him in the high,
false note of barbarous mourning, such as still lingers
modified among Scots heather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord peety ye, Hermiston! the Lord prepare
ye!&rdquo; she keened out. &ldquo;Weary upon me, that I should
have to tell it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reined in his horse and looked upon her with the
hanging face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the French landit?&rdquo; cried he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man, man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is that a&rsquo; ye can think of?
The Lord prepare ye: the Lord comfort and support ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is onybody deid?&rdquo; says his lordship. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no
Erchie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bethankit, no!&rdquo; exclaimed the woman, startled into
a more natural tone. &ldquo;Na, na, it&rsquo;s no sae bad as that.
It&rsquo;s the mistress, my lord; she just fair flittit before my e&rsquo;en.
She just gi&rsquo;ed a sab and was by wi&rsquo; it. Eh, my bonny Miss
Jeannie, that I mind sae weel!&rdquo; And forth again upon that
pouring tide of lamentation in which women of her class
excel and over-abound.</p>

<p>Lord Hermiston sat in the saddle beholding her. Then
he seemed to recover command upon himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, it&rsquo;s something of the suddenest,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But
she was a dwaibly body from the first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he rode home at a precipitate amble with Kirstie
at his horse&rsquo;s heels.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span></p>

<p>Dressed as she was for her last walk, they had laid the
dead lady on her bed. She was never interesting in life;
in death she was not impressive; and as her husband stood
before her, with his hands crossed behind his powerful
back, that which he looked upon was the very image of the
insignificant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her and me were never cut out for one another,&rdquo; he
remarked at last. &ldquo;It was a daft-like marriage.&rdquo; And
then, with a most unusual gentleness of tone, &ldquo;Puir bitch,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;puir bitch!&rdquo; Then suddenly: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Erchie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kirstie had decoyed him to her room and given him &ldquo;a
jeely-piece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye have some kind of gumption, too,&rdquo; observed the
judge, and considered his housekeeper grimly. &ldquo;When
all&rsquo;s said,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I micht have done waur&mdash;I micht
have been marriet upon a skirling Jezebel like you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s naebody thinking of you, Hermiston!&rdquo; cried
the offended woman. &ldquo;We think of her that&rsquo;s out of her
sorrows. And could <i>she</i> have done waur? Tell me that,
Hermiston&mdash;tell me that before her clay-cauld corp!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, there&rsquo;s some of them gey an&rsquo; ill to please,&rdquo;
observed his lordship.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>FATHER AND SON</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">My</span> Lord Justice-Clerk was known to many; the man Adam
Weir perhaps to none. He had nothing to explain or to
conceal; he sufficed wholly and silently to himself; and
that part of our nature which goes out (too often with false
coin) to acquire glory or love, seemed in him to be omitted.
He did not try to be loved, he did not care to be; it is probable
the very thought of it was a stranger to his mind. He
was an admired lawyer, a highly unpopular judge; and he
looked down upon those who were his inferiors in either
distinction, who were lawyers of less grasp or judges not so
much detested. In all the rest of his days and doings, not
one trace of vanity appeared; and he went on through life
with a mechanical movement, as of the unconscious, that
was almost august.</p>

<p>He saw little of his son. In the childish maladies with
which the boy was troubled, he would make daily inquiries
and daily pay him a visit, entering the sick-room with a
facetious and appalling countenance, letting off a few perfunctory
jests, and going again swiftly, to the patient&rsquo;s
relief. Once, a Court holiday falling opportunely, my lord
had his carriage, and drove the child himself to Hermiston,
the customary place of convalescence. It is conceivable
he had been more than usually anxious, for that journey
always remained in Archie&rsquo;s memory as a thing apart, his
father having related to him from beginning to end, and with
much detail, three authentic murder cases. Archie went
the usual round of other Edinburgh boys, the High School
and the College; and Hermiston looked on, or rather looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
away, with scarce an affectation of interest in his progress.
Daily, indeed, upon a signal after dinner, he was brought in,
given nuts and a glass of port, regarded sardonically, sarcastically
questioned. &ldquo;Well, sir, and what have you donn
with your book to-day?&rdquo; my lord might begin, and set him
posers in law Latin. To a child just stumbling into
Corderius, Papinian and Paul proved quite invincible. But
papa had memory of no other. He was not harsh to the
little scholar, having a vast fund of patience learned upon
the Bench, and was at no pains whether to conceal or to
express his disappointment. &ldquo;Well, ye have a long jaunt
before ye yet!&rdquo; he might observe, yawning, and fall back
on his own thoughts (as like as not) until the time came for
separation, and my lord would take the decanter and the
glass, and be off to the back chamber looking on the
Meadows, where he toiled on his cases till the hours were small.
There was no &ldquo;fuller man&rdquo; on the Bench; his memory was
marvellous, though wholly legal; if he had to &ldquo;advise&rdquo;
extempore, none did it better; yet there was none who more
earnestly prepared. As he thus watched in the night, or
sat at table and forgot the presence of his son, no doubt but
he tasted deeply of recondite pleasures. To be wholly
devoted to some intellectual exercise is to have succeeded
in life; and perhaps only in law and the higher mathematics
may this devotion be maintained, suffice to itself
without reaction, and find continual rewards without excitement.
This atmosphere of his father&rsquo;s sterling industry
was the best of Archie&rsquo;s education. Assuredly it did not
attract him; assuredly it rather rebutted and depressed.
Yet it was still present, unobserved like the ticking of a
clock, an arid ideal, a tasteless stimulant in the boy&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>But Hermiston was not all of one piece. He was, besides,
a mighty toper; he could sit at wine until the day
dawned, and pass directly from the table to the Bench with
a steady hand and a clear head. Beyond the third bottle,
he showed the plebeian in a larger print; the low, gross
accent, the low, foul mirth, grew broader and commoner;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
he became less formidable, and infinitely more disgusting.
Now, the boy had inherited from Jean Rutherford a shivering
delicacy, unequally mated with potential violence. In
the playing-fields, and amongst his own companions, he
repaid a coarse expression with a blow; at his father&rsquo;s table
(when the time came for him to join these revels) he turned
pale and sickened in silence. Of all the guests whom he
there encountered, he had toleration for only one: David
Keith Carnegie, Lord Glenalmond. Lord Glenalmond was
tall and emaciated, with long features and long delicate
hands. He was often compared with the statue of Forbes
of Culloden in the Parliament House; and his blue eye, at
more than sixty, preserved some of the fire of youth. His
exquisite disparity with any of his fellow-guests, his appearance
as of an artist and an aristocrat stranded in rude company,
riveted the boy&rsquo;s attention; and as curiosity and
interest are the things in the world that are the most immediately
and certainly rewarded, Lord Glenalmond was
attracted by the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so this is your son, Hermiston?&rdquo; he asked, laying
his hand on Archie&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting a big lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hout!&rdquo; said the gracious father, &ldquo;just his mother
over again&mdash;daurna say boo to a goose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the stranger retained the boy, talked to him, drew
him out, found in him a taste for letters, and a fine, ardent,
modest, youthful soul; and encouraged him to be a visitor
on Sunday evenings in his bare, cold, lonely dining-room,
where he sat and read in the isolation of a bachelor grown
old in refinement. The beautiful gentleness and grace of
the old judge, and the delicacy of his person, thoughts, and
language, spoke to Archie&rsquo;s heart in its own tongue. He conceived
the ambition to be such another; and, when the day
came for him to choose a profession, it was in emulation of
Lord Glenalmond, not of Lord Hermiston, that he chose the
Bar. Hermiston looked on at this friendship with some
secret pride, but openly with the intolerance of scorn. He
scarce lost an opportunity to put them down with a rough
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
jape; and, to say truth, it was not difficult, for they were
neither of them quick. He had a word of contempt for the
whole crowd of poets, painters, fiddlers, and their admirers,
the bastard race of amateurs, which was continually on his
lips. &ldquo;Signor Feedle-eerie!&rdquo; he would say. &ldquo;O, for
Goad&rsquo;s sake, no more of the Signor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and my father are great friends, are you not?&rdquo;
asked Archie once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no man that I more respect, Archie,&rdquo; replied
Lord Glenalmond. &ldquo;He is two things of price: he is a
great lawyer, and he is upright as the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You and he are so different,&rdquo; said the boy, his eyes
dwelling on those of his old friend, like a lover&rsquo;s on his
mistress&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed so,&rdquo; replied the judge; &ldquo;very different. And
so I fear are you and he. Yet I would like it very ill if my
young friend were to misjudge his father. He has all the
Roman virtues: Cato and Brutus were such; I think a son&rsquo;s
heart might well be proud of such an ancestry of one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I would sooner he were a plaided herd,&rdquo; cried
Archie, with sudden bitterness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is neither very wise, nor I believe entirely
true,&rdquo; returned Glenalmond. &ldquo;Before you are done you
will find some of these expressions rise on you like a remorse.
They are merely literary and decorative; they do not aptly
express your thought, nor is your thought clearly apprehended,
and no doubt your father (if he were here) would
say, &lsquo;Signor Feedle-eerie!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the infinitely delicate sense of youth, Archie
avoided the subject from that hour. It was perhaps a pity.
Had he but talked&mdash;talked freely&mdash;let himself gush out in
words (the way youth loves to do, and should), there might
have been no tale to write upon the Weirs of Hermiston.
But the shadow of a threat of ridicule sufficed; in the slight
tartness of these words he read a prohibition; and it is
likely that Glenalmond meant it so.</p>

<p>Besides the veteran, the boy was without confidant or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
friend. Serious and eager, he came through school and
college, and moved among a crowd of the indifferent, in the
seclusion of his shyness. He grew up handsome, with an
open, speaking countenance, with graceful, youthful ways;
he was clever, he took prizes, he shone in the Speculative
Society. It should seem he must become the centre of a
crowd of friends; but something that was in part the
delicacy of his mother, in part the austerity of his father,
held him aloof from all. It is a fact, and a strange one, that
among his contemporaries Hermiston&rsquo;s son was thought to
be a chip of the old block. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a friend of Archie
Weir&rsquo;s?&rdquo; said one to Frank Innes; and Innes replied, with
his usual flippancy and more than his usual insight: &ldquo;I
know Weir, but I never met Archie.&rdquo; No one had met
Archie, a malady most incident to only sons. He flew his
private signal, and none heeded it; it seemed he was abroad
in a world from which the very hope of intimacy was
banished; and he looked round about him on the concourse
of his fellow-students, and forward to the trivial days and
acquaintances that were to come, without hope or interest.</p>

<p>As time went on, the tough and rough old sinner felt
himself drawn to the son of his loins and sole continuator of
his new family, with softnesses of sentiment that he could
hardly credit and was wholly impotent to express. With
a face, voice, and manner trained through forty years to
terrify and repel, Rhadamanthus may be great, but he will
scarce be engaging. It is a fact that he tried to propitiate
Archie, but a fact that cannot be too lightly taken; the
attempt was so unconspicuously made, the failure so stoically
supported. Sympathy is not due to these steadfast iron
natures. If he failed to gain his son&rsquo;s friendship, or even
his son&rsquo;s toleration, on he went up the great, bare staircase
of his duty, uncheered and undepressed. There might have
been more pleasure in his relations with Archie, so much
he may have recognised at moments; but pleasure was a
by-product of the singular chemistry of life, which only
fools expected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span></p>

<p>An idea of Archie&rsquo;s attitude, since we are all grown up
and have forgotten the days of our youth, it is more difficult
to convey. He made no attempt whatsoever to understand
the man with whom he dined and breakfasted. Parsimony
of pain, glut of pleasure, these are the two alternating ends
of youth; and Archie was of the parsimonious. The wind
blew cold out of a certain quarter&mdash;he turned his back upon
it; stayed as little as was possible in his father&rsquo;s presence;
and when there, averted his eyes as much as was decent
from his father&rsquo;s face. The lamp shone for many hundred
days upon these two at table&mdash;my lord ruddy, gloomy, and
unreverend; Archie with a potential brightness that was
always dimmed and veiled in that society; and there were
not, perhaps, in Christendom two men more radically
strangers. The father, with a grand simplicity, either spoke
of what interested himself, or maintained an unaffected
silence. The son turned in his head for some topic that
should be quite safe, that would spare him fresh evidences
either of my lord&rsquo;s inherent grossness or of the innocence of
his inhumanity; treading gingerly the ways of intercourse,
like a lady gathering up her skirts in a by-path. If he made
a mistake, and my lord began to abound in matter of offence,
Archie drew himself up, his brow grew dark, his share of
the talk expired; but my lord would faithfully and cheerfully
continue to pour out the worst of himself before his
silent and offended son.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a poor hert that never rejoices!&rdquo; he would
say, at the conclusion of such a nightmare interview. &ldquo;But
I must get to my plew-stilts.&rdquo; And he would seclude himself
as usual in the back room, and Archie go forth into the
night and the city quivering with animosity and scorn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>IN THE MATTER OF THE HANGING OF
DUNCAN JOPP</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> chanced in the year 1813 that Archie strayed one day
into the Justiciary Court. The macer made room for the
son of the presiding judge. In the dock, the centre of men&rsquo;s
eyes, there stood a whey-coloured, misbegotten caitiff,
Duncan Jopp, on trial for his life. His story, as it was
raked out before him in that public scene, was one of disgrace
and vice and cowardice, the very nakedness of crime;
and the creature heard, and it seemed at times as though he
understood&mdash;as if at times he forgot the horror of the place
he stood in, and remembered the shame of what had brought
him there. He kept his head bowed and his hands clutched
upon the rail; his hair dropped in his eyes and at times he
flung it back; and now he glanced about the audience in a
sudden fellness of terror, and now looked in the face of his
judge and gulped. There was pinned about his throat a
piece of dingy flannel; and this it was perhaps that turned
the scale in Archie&rsquo;s mind between disgust and pity. The
creature stood in a vanishing point; yet a little while, and
he was still a man, and had eyes and apprehension; yet a
little longer, and with a last sordid piece of pageantry, he
would cease to be. And here, in the meantime, with a trait
of human nature that caught at the beholder&rsquo;s breath, he
was tending a sore throat.</p>

<p>Over against him, my Lord Hermiston occupied the
Bench in the red robes of criminal jurisdiction, his face
framed in the white wig. Honest all through, he did not
affect the virtue of impartiality; this was no case for refinement;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
there was a man to be hanged, he would have
said, and he was hanging him. Nor was it possible to see
his lordship, and acquit him of gusto in the task. It was
plain he gloried in the exercise of his trained faculties, in the
clear sight which pierced at once into the joint of fact, in
the rude, unvarnished gibes with which he demolished every
figment of defence. He took his ease and jested, unbending
in that solemn place with some of the freedom of the tavern;
and the rag of man with the flannel round his neck was
hunted gallowsward with jeers.</p>

<p>Duncan had a mistress, scarce less forlorn and greatly
older than himself, who came up, whimpering and curtseying,
to add the weight of her betrayal. My lord gave her
the oath in his most roaring voice, and added an intolerant
warning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mind what ye say now, Janet,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have an
e&rsquo;e upon ye, I&rsquo;m ill to jest with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently, after she was tremblingly embarked on
her story, &ldquo;And what made ye do this, ye auld runt?&rdquo;
the Court interposed. &ldquo;Do ye mean to tell me ye was the
panel&rsquo;s mistress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please, ma loard,&rdquo; whined the female.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Godsake! ye made a bonny couple,&rdquo; observed his
lordship; and there was something so formidable and
ferocious in his scorn that not even the galleries thought
to laugh.</p>

<p>The summing up contained some jewels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These two peetiable creatures seem to have made up
thegither, it&rsquo;s not for us to explain why.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The panel,
who (whatever else he may be) appears to be equally ill set-out
in mind and boady.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Neither the panel nor yet the
old wife appears to have had so much common sense as even
to tell a lie when it was necessary.&rdquo; And in the course of
sentencing, my lord had this <i>obiter dictum</i>: &ldquo;I have been
the means, under God, of haanging a great number, but
never just such a disjaskit rascal as yourself.&rdquo; The words
were strong in themselves; the light and heat and detonation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
of their delivery, and the savage pleasure of the speaker
in his task, made them tingle in the ears.</p>

<p>When all was over, Archie came forth again into a
changed world. Had there been the least redeeming greatness
in the crime, any obscurity, any dubiety, perhaps he
might have understood. But the culprit stood, with his
sore throat, in the sweat of his mortal agony, without defence
or excuse: a thing to cover up with blushes: a being
so much sunk beneath the zones of sympathy that pity
might seem harmless. And the judge had pursued him with
a monstrous, relishing gaiety, horrible to be conceived, a
trait for nightmares. It is one thing to spear a tiger,
another to crush a toad; there are æsthetics even of the
slaughter-house; and the loathsomeness of Duncan Jopp
enveloped and infected the image of his judge.</p>

<p>Archie passed by his friends in the High Street with
incoherent words and gestures. He saw Holyrood in a
dream, remembrance of its romance awoke in him and
faded; he had a vision of the old radiant stories, of Queen
Mary and Prince Charlie, of the hooded stag, of the splendour
and crime, the velvet and bright iron of the past; and
dismissed them with a cry of pain. He lay and moaned
in the Hunter&rsquo;s Bog, and the heavens were dark above
him and the grass of the field an offence. &ldquo;This is my
father,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I draw my life from him; the flesh
upon my bones is his, the bread I am fed with is the wages
of these horrors.&rdquo; He recalled his mother, and ground
his forehead in the earth. He thought of flight, and
where was he to flee to? of other lives, but was there any
life worth living in this den of savage and jeering animals?</p>

<p>The interval before the execution was like a violent
dream. He met his father; he would not look at him, he
could not speak to him. It seemed there was no living
creature but must have been swift to recognise that imminent
animosity; but the hide of the Justice-Clerk remained
impenetrable. Had my lord been talkative, the truce
could never have subsisted; but he was by fortune in one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
his humours of sour silence; and under the very guns of his
broadside, Archie nursed the enthusiasm of rebellion. It
seemed to him, from the top of his nineteen years&rsquo; experience,
as if he were marked at birth to be the perpetrator of
some signal action, to set back fallen Mercy, to overthrow
the usurping devil that sat, horned and hoofed, on her
throne. Seductive Jacobin figments, which he had often
refuted at the Speculative, swam up in his mind and
startled him as with voices: and he seemed to himself to
walk accompanied by an almost tangible presence of new
beliefs and duties.</p>

<p>On the named morning he was at the place of execution.
He saw the fleering rabble, the flinching wretch produced.
He looked on for a while at a certain parody of devotion,
which seemed to strip the wretch of his last claim to manhood.
Then followed the brutal instant of extinction, and
the paltry dangling of the remains like a broken jumping-jack.
He had been prepared for something terrible, not
for this tragic meanness. He stood a moment silent, and
then&mdash;&ldquo;I denounce this God-defying murder,&rdquo; he shouted;
and his father, if he must have disclaimed the sentiment,
might have owned the stentorian voice with which it was
uttered.</p>

<p>Frank Innes dragged him from the spot. The two
handsome lads followed the same course of study and recreation,
and felt a certain mutual attraction, founded
mainly on good looks. It had never gone deep; Frank
was by nature a thin, jeering creature, not truly susceptible
whether of feeling or inspiring friendship; and the relation
between the pair was altogether on the outside, a thing of
common knowledge and the pleasantries that spring from
a common acquaintance. The more credit to Frank that
he was appalled by Archie&rsquo;s outburst, and at least conceived
the design of keeping him in sight, and, if possible, in hand
for the day. But Archie, who had just defied&mdash;was it God
or Satan?&mdash;would not listen to the word of a college companion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not go with you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I do not desire
your company, sir; I would be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Weir, man, don&rsquo;t be absurd,&rdquo; said Innes, keeping
a tight hold upon his sleeve. &ldquo;I will not let you go until I
know what you mean to do with yourself; it&rsquo;s no use
brandishing that staff.&rdquo; For indeed at that moment Archie
had made a sudden&mdash;perhaps a warlike&mdash;movement.
&ldquo;This has been the most insane affair; you know it has.
You know very well that I&rsquo;m playing the good Samaritan.
All I wish is to keep you quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If quietness is what you wish, Mr. Innes,&rdquo; said Archie,
&ldquo;and you will promise to leave me entirely to myself, I will
tell you so much, that I am going to walk in the country
and admire the beauties of nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honour bright?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not in the habit of lying, Mr. Innes,&rdquo; retorted
Archie. &ldquo;I have the honour of wishing you good-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget the Spec.?&rdquo; asked Innes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Spec.?&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;O no, I won&rsquo;t forget
the Spec.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the one young man carried his tortured spirit forth
of the city and all the day long, by one road and another,
in an endless pilgrimage of misery; while the other hastened
smilingly to spread the news of Weir&rsquo;s access of insanity,
and to drum up for that night a full attendance at the
Speculative, where further eccentric developments might
certainly be looked for. I doubt if Innes had the least belief
in his prediction; I think it flowed rather from a wish to
make the story as good and the scandal as great as possible;
not from any ill-will to Archie&mdash;from the mere pleasure of
beholding interested faces. But for all that his words were
prophetic. Archie did not forget the Spec.; he put in an
appearance there at the due time, and, before the evening
was over, had dealt a memorable shock to his companions.
It chanced he was the president of the night. He sat in the
same room where the Society still meets&mdash;only the portraits
were not there: the men who afterwards sat for them were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
then but beginning their careers. The same lustre of many
tapers shed its light over the meeting; the same chair, perhaps,
supported him that so many of us have sat in since.
At times he seemed to forget the business of the evening,
but even in these periods he sat with a great air of energy
and determination. At times he meddled bitterly, and
launched with defiance those fines which are the precious
and rarely used artillery of the president. He little thought,
as he did so, how he resembled his father, but his friends
remarked upon it, chuckling. So far, in his high place above
his fellow-students, he seemed set beyond the possibility of
any scandal; but his mind was made up&mdash;he was determined
to fulfil the sphere of his offence. He signed to Innes (whom
he had just fined and who had just impeached his ruling)
to succeed him in the chair, stepped down from the platform,
and took his place by the chimney-piece, the shine of
many wax tapers from above illuminating his pale face, the
glow of the great red fire relieving from behind his slim
figure. He had to propose, as an amendment to the next
subject in the case-book, &ldquo;Whether capital punishment
be consistent with God&rsquo;s will or man&rsquo;s policy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A breath of embarrassment, of something like alarm,
passed round the room, so daring did these words appear
upon the lips of Hermiston&rsquo;s only son. But the amendment
was not seconded; the previous question was promptly
moved and unanimously voted, and the momentary scandal
smuggled by. Innes triumphed in the fulfilment of his
prophecy. He and Archie were now become the heroes of
the night; but whereas every one crowded about Innes,
when the meeting broke up, but one of all his companions
came to speak to Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weir, man! That was an extraordinary raid of
yours!&rdquo; observed this courageous member, taking him confidentially
by the arm as they went out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it a raid,&rdquo; said Archie grimly. &ldquo;More
like a war. I saw that poor brute hanged this morning, and
my gorge rises at it yet.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hut-tut,&rdquo; returned his companion, and, dropping his
arm like something hot, he sought the less tense society of
others.</p>

<p>Archie found himself alone. The last of the faithful&mdash;or
was it only the boldest of the curious?&mdash;had fled. He
watched the black huddle of his fellow-students draw off
down and up the street, in whispering or boisterous gangs.
And the isolation of the moment weighed upon him like an
omen and an emblem of his destiny in life. Bred up in
unbroken fear himself, among trembling servants, and in
a house which (at the least ruffle in the master&rsquo;s voice)
shuddered into silence, he saw himself on the brink of the
red valley of war, and measured the danger and length of
it with awe. He made a détour in the glimmer and shadow
of the streets, came into the back stable lane, and watched
for a long while the light burn steady in the judge&rsquo;s room.
The longer he gazed upon that illuminated window-blind,
the more blank became the picture of the man who sat
behind it, endlessly turning over sheets of process, pausing
to sip a glass of port, or rising and passing heavily about his
book-lined walls to verify some reference. He could not
combine the brutal judge and the industrious, dispassionate
student; the connecting link escaped him; from such a dual
nature it was impossible he should predict behaviour; and
he asked himself if he had done well to plunge into a business
of which the end could not be foreseen? and presently after,
with a sickening decline of confidence, if he had done loyally
to strike his father? For he had struck him&mdash;defied him
twice over and before a cloud of witnesses&mdash;struck him a
public buffet before crowds. Who had called him to judge
his father in these precarious and high questions? The
office was usurped. It might have become a stranger; in
a son&mdash;there was no blinking it&mdash;in a son, it was disloyal.
And now, between these two natures so antipathetic, so
hateful to each other, there was depending an unpardonable
affront: and the providence of God alone might foresee the
manner in which it would be resented by Lord Hermiston.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span></p>

<p>These misgivings tortured him all night and arose with
him in the winter&rsquo;s morning; they followed him from class
to class, they made him shrinkingly sensitive to every shade
of manner in his companions, they sounded in his ears
through the current voice of the professor; and he brought
them home with him at night unabated and indeed increased.
The cause of this increase lay in a chance encounter with the
celebrated Dr. Gregory. Archie stood looking vaguely in
the lighted window of a book-shop, trying to nerve himself
for the approaching ordeal. My lord and he had met and
parted in the morning as they had now done for long, with
scarcely the ordinary civilities of life; and it was plain to
the son that nothing had yet reached the father&rsquo;s ears.
Indeed, when he recalled the awful countenance of my lord,
a timid hope sprang up in him that perhaps there would be
found no one bold enough to carry tales. If this were so,
he asked himself, would he begin again? and he found no
answer. It was at this moment that a hand was laid upon
his arm, and a voice said in his ear, &ldquo;My dear Mr. Archie,
you had better come and see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started, turned round, and found himself face to face
with Dr. Gregory. &ldquo;And why should I come to see you?&rdquo;
he asked, with the defiance of the miserable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you are looking exceedingly ill,&rdquo; said the
doctor, &ldquo;and you very evidently want looking after, my
young friend. Good folk are scarce, you know; and it is
not every one that would be quite so much missed as yourself.
It is not every one that Hermiston would miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with a nod and a smile, the doctor passed on.</p>

<p>A moment after, Archie was in pursuit, and had in turn,
but more roughly, seized him by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? what did you mean by saying
that? What makes you think that Hermis&mdash;my father
would have missed me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor turned about and looked him all over with a
clinical eye. A far more stupid man than Dr. Gregory
might have guessed the truth; but ninety-nine out of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>189</span>
hundred, even if they had been equally inclined to kindness,
would have blundered by some touch of charitable exaggeration.
The doctor was better inspired. He knew the father
well; in that white face of intelligence and suffering, he
divined something of the son; and he told, without apology
or adornment, the plain truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you had the measles, Mr. Archibald, you had
them gey and ill; and I thought you were going to slip
between my fingers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, your father was
anxious. How did I know it? says you. Simply because
I am a trained observer. The sign that I saw him make,
ten thousand would have missed; and perhaps&mdash;<i>perhaps</i>, I
say, because he&rsquo;s a hard man to judge of&mdash;but perhaps he
never made another. A strange thing to consider! It was
this. One day I came to him: &lsquo;Hermiston,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s
a change.&rsquo; He never said a word, just glowered at me (if
ye&rsquo;ll pardon the phrase) like a wild beast. &lsquo;A change for
the better,&rsquo; said I. And I distinctly heard him take his
breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor left no opportunity for anti-climax; nodding
his cocked hat (a piece of antiquity to which he clung) and
repeating &ldquo;Distinctly&rdquo; with raised eyebrows, he took his
departure, and left Archie speechless in the street.</p>

<p>The anecdote might be called infinitely little, and yet
its meaning for Archie was immense. &ldquo;I did not know the
old man had so much blood in him.&rdquo; He had never dreamed
this sire of his, this aboriginal antique, this adamantine
Adam, had even so much of a heart as to be moved in the
least degree for another&mdash;and that other himself, who had
insulted him! With the generosity of youth, Archie was
instantly under arms upon the other side: had instantly
created a new image of Lord Hermiston, that of a man who
was all iron without and all sensibility within. The mind of
the vile jester, the tongue that had pursued Duncan Jopp
with unmanly insults, the unbeloved countenance that he
had known and feared for so long, were all forgotten; and
he hastened home, impatient to confess his misdeeds, impatient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
to throw himself on the mercy of this imaginary
character.</p>

<p>He was not to be long without a rude awakening. It
was in the gloaming when he drew near the doorstep of the
lighted house, and was aware of the figure of his father
approaching from the opposite side. Little daylight lingered;
but on the door being opened, the strong yellow shine
of the lamp gushed out upon the landing and shone full
on Archie, as he stood, in the old-fashioned observance of
respect, to yield precedence. The judge came without
haste, stepping stately and firm; his chin raised, his face
(as he entered the lamplight) strongly illumined, his mouth
set hard. There was never a wink of change in his expression;
without looking to the right or left, he mounted the
stair, passed close to Archie, and entered the house. Instinctively,
the boy, upon his first coming, had made a movement
to meet him; instinctively he recoiled against the
railing, as the old man swept by him in a pomp of indignation.
Words were needless; he knew all&mdash;perhaps more than
all&mdash;and the hour of judgment was at hand.</p>

<p>It is possible that, in this sudden revulsion of hope and
before these symptoms of impending danger, Archie might
have fled. But not even that was left to him. My lord, after
hanging up his cloak and hat, turned round in the lighted
entry, and made him an imperative and silent gesture with
his thumb, and with the strange instinct of obedience,
Archie followed him into the house.</p>

<p>All dinner-time there reigned over the judge&rsquo;s table a
palpable silence, and as soon as the solids were despatched
he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;Killop, tak&rsquo; the wine into my room,&rdquo; said he; and
then to his son: &ldquo;Archie, you and me has to have a talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was at this sickening moment that Archie&rsquo;s courage,
for the first and last time, entirely deserted him. &ldquo;I have
an appointment,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll have to be broken, then,&rdquo; said Hermiston, and led
the way into his study.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span></p>

<p>The lamp was shaded, the fire trimmed to a nicety, the
table covered deep with orderly documents, the backs of
law-books made a frame upon all sides that was only
broken by the window and the doors.</p>

<p>For a moment Hermiston warmed his hands at the fire,
presenting his back to Archie; then suddenly disclosed on
him the terrors of the Hanging Face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I hear of ye?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>There was no answer possible to Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to tell ye, then,&rdquo; pursued Hermiston. &ldquo;It
seems ye&rsquo;ve been skirling against the father that begot ye,
and one of his Maijesty&rsquo;s judges in this land; and that in
the public street, and while an order of the Court was being
executit. Forbye which, it would appear that ye&rsquo;ve been
airing your opeenions in a Coallege Debatin&rsquo; Society&rdquo;; he
paused a moment: and then, with extraordinary bitterness,
added: &ldquo;Ye damned eediot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had meant to tell you,&rdquo; stammered Archie. &ldquo;I
see you are well informed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Muckle obleeged to ye,&rdquo; said his lordship, and took his
usual seat. &ldquo;And so you disapprove of caapital punishment?&rdquo;
he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, sir, I do,&rdquo; said Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, too,&rdquo; said his lordship. &ldquo;And now, if
you please, we shall approach this business with a little more
parteecularity. I hear that at the hanging of Duncan Jopp&mdash;and,
man! ye had a fine client there&mdash;in the middle of
all the riffraff of the ceety, ye thought fit to cry out, &lsquo;This
is a damned murder, and my gorge rises at the man that
haangit him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir, these were not my words,&rdquo; cried Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were yer words, then?&rdquo; asked the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I said, &lsquo;I denounce it as a murder!&rsquo;&rdquo; said
the son. &ldquo;I beg your pardon&mdash;a God-defying murder.
I have no wish to conceal the truth,&rdquo; he added, and looked
his father for a moment in the face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God, it would only need that of it next!&rdquo; cried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
Hermiston. &ldquo;There was nothing about your gorge rising,
then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was afterwards, my lord, as I was leaving the
Speculative. I said I had been to see the miserable creature
hanged, and my gorge rose at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did ye, though?&rdquo; said Hermiston. &ldquo;And I suppose
ye knew who haangit him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was present at the trial; I ought to tell you that, I
ought to explain. I ask your pardon beforehand for any
expression that may seem undutiful. The position in which
I stand is wretched,&rdquo; said the unhappy hero, now fairly
face to face with the business he had chosen. &ldquo;I have been
reading some of your cases. I was present while Jopp was
tried. It was a hideous business. Father, it was a hideous
thing! Grant he was vile, why should you hunt him with
a vileness equal to his own? It was done with glee&mdash;that
is the word&mdash;you did it with glee; and I looked on, God help
me! with horror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a young gentleman that doesna approve of
caapital punishment,&rdquo; said Hermiston. &ldquo;Weel, I&rsquo;m an
auld man that does. I was glad to get Jopp haangit, and
what for would I pretend I wasna? You&rsquo;re all for honesty,
it seems; you couldn&rsquo;t even steik your mouth on the public
street. What for should I steik mines upon the Bench, the
King&rsquo;s officer, bearing the sword, a dreid to evil-doers, as I
was from the beginning, and as I will be to the end! Mair
than enough of it! Heedious! I never gave twa thoughts
to heediousness, I have no call to be bonny. I&rsquo;m a man that
gets through with my day&rsquo;s business, and let that suffice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ring of sarcasm had died out of his voice as he went
on; the plain words became invested with some of the
dignity of the Justice-seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be telling you if you could say as much,&rdquo; the
speaker resumed. &ldquo;But ye cannot. Ye&rsquo;ve been reading
some of my cases, ye say. But it was not for the law in
them, it was to spy out your faither&rsquo;s nakedness, a fine employment
in a son. You&rsquo;re splairging; you&rsquo;re running at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
lairge in life like a wild nowt. It&rsquo;s impossible you should
think any longer of coming to the Bar. You&rsquo;re not fit for
it; no splairger is. And another thing: son of mines or
no son of mines, you have flung fylement in public on one of
the Senators of the Coallege of Justice, and I would make it
my business to see that ye were never admitted there yourself.
There is a kind of a decency to be observit. Then
comes the next of it&mdash;what am I to do with ye next? Ye&rsquo;ll
have to find some kind of a trade, for I&rsquo;ll never support ye
in idleset. What do ye fancy ye&rsquo;ll be fit for? The pulpit?
Na, they could never get diveenity into that bloackhead.
Him that the law of man whammles is no likely to do muckle
better by the law of God. What would ye make of hell?
Wouldna your gorge rise at that? Na, there&rsquo;s no room for
splairgers under the fower quarters of John Calvin. What
else is there? Speak up. Have ye got nothing of your
own?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father, let me go to the Peninsula,&rdquo; said Archie.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m fit for&mdash;to fight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All? quo&rsquo; he!&rdquo; returned the judge. &ldquo;And it would
be enough too, if I thought it. But I&rsquo;ll never trust ye so
near the French, you that&rsquo;s so Frenchifeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do me injustice there, sir,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;I am
loyal; I will not boast; but any interest I may have ever
felt in the French&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have ye been so loyal to me?&rdquo; interrupted his father.</p>

<p>There came no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; continued Hermiston. &ldquo;And I would
send no man to be a servant to the King, God bless him!
that has proved such a shauchling son to his own faither.
You can splairge here on Edinburgh street, and where&rsquo;s the
hairm? It doesna play buff on me! And if there were
twenty thousand eediots like yourself, sorrow a Duncan
Jopp would hang the fewer. But there&rsquo;s no splairging
possible in a camp; and if you were to go to it, you would
find out for yourself whether Lord Well&rsquo;n&rsquo;ton approves of
caapital punishment or not. You a sodger!&rdquo; he cried, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
a sudden burst of scorn. &ldquo;Ye auld wife, the sodgers would
bray at ye like cuddies!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As at the drawing of a curtain, Archie was aware of some
illogicality in his position, and stood abashed. He had a
strong impression, besides, of the essential valour of the
old gentleman before him, how conveyed it would be hard
to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, have ye no other proposeetion?&rdquo; said my lord
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have taken this so calmly, sir, that I cannot but
stand ashamed,&rdquo; began Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nearer voamiting, though, than you would fancy,&rdquo;
said my lord.</p>

<p>The blood rose to Archie&rsquo;s brow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, I should have said that you had
accepted my affront.... I admit it was an affront; I
did not think to apologise, but I do, I ask your pardon; it
will not be so again, I pass you my word of honour....
I should have said that I admired your magnanimity with&mdash;this&mdash;offender,&rdquo;
Archie concluded with a gulp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no other son, ye see,&rdquo; said Hermiston. &ldquo;A
bonny one I have gotten! But I must just do the best I can
wi&rsquo; him, and what am I to do? If ye had been younger, I
would have wheepit ye for this rideeculous exhibeetion.
The way it is, I have just to grin and bear. But one thing
is to be clearly understood. As a faither, I must grin and
bear it; but if I had been the Lord Advocate instead of
the Lord Justice-Clerk, son or no son, Mr. Erchibald Weir
would have been in a jyle the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archie was now dominated. Lord Hermiston was
coarse and cruel; and yet the son was aware of a bloomless
nobility, an ungracious abnegation of the man&rsquo;s self in the
man&rsquo;s office. At every word, this sense of the greatness of
Lord Hermiston&rsquo;s spirit struck more home; and along with
it that of his own impotence, who had struck&mdash;and perhaps
basely struck&mdash;at his own father, and not reached so far as
to have even nettled him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I place myself in your hands without reserve,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the first sensible word I&rsquo;ve had of ye the night,&rdquo;
said Hermiston. &ldquo;I can tell ye, that would have been the
end of it, the one way or the other; but it&rsquo;s better ye should
come there yourself, than what I would have had to hirstle
ye. Weel, by my way of it&mdash;and my way is the best&mdash;there&rsquo;s
just the one thing it&rsquo;s possible that ye might be with decency,
and that&rsquo;s a laird. Ye&rsquo;ll be out of hairm&rsquo;s way at the least
of it. If ye have to rowt, ye can rowt amang the kye; and
the maist feck of the caapital punishment ye&rsquo;re like to come
across&rsquo;ll be guddling trouts. Now, I&rsquo;m for no idle lairdies;
every man has to work, if it&rsquo;s only at peddling ballants; to
work, or to be wheeped, or to be haangit. If I set ye down
at Hermiston, I&rsquo;ll have to see you work that place the way
it has never been workit yet; ye must ken about the sheep
like a herd; ye must be my grieve there, and I&rsquo;ll see that I
gain by ye. Is that understood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will do my best,&rdquo; said Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll send Kirstie word the morn, and ye can
go yourself the day after,&rdquo; said Hermiston. &ldquo;And just try
to be less of an eediot!&rdquo; he concluded, with a freezing smile,
and turned immediately to the papers on his desk.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>OPINIONS OF THE BENCH</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Late</span> the same night, after a disordered walk, Archie was
admitted into Lord Glenalmond&rsquo;s dining-room, where he sat,
with a book upon his knee, beside three frugal coals of fire.
In his robes upon the Bench, Glenalmond had a certain air
of burliness: plucked of these, it was a may-pole of a man
that rose unsteadily from his chair to give his visitor welcome.
Archie had suffered much in the last days, he had
suffered again that evening; his face was white and drawn,
his eyes wild and dark. But Lord Glenalmond greeted him
without the least mark of surprise or curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Come in and take a
seat. Carstairs&rdquo; (to his servant), &ldquo;make up the fire, and
then you can bring a bit of supper,&rdquo; and again to Archie, with
a very trivial accent: &ldquo;I was half expecting you,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No supper,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;It is impossible that I
should eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not impossible,&rdquo; said the tall old man, laying his hand
upon his shoulder, &ldquo;and, if you will believe me, necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what brings me?&rdquo; said Archie, as soon as
the servant had left the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a guess, I have a guess,&rdquo; replied Glenalmond.
&ldquo;We will talk of it presently&mdash;when Carstairs has come and
gone, and you have had a piece of my good Cheddar cheese
and a pull at the porter tankard: not before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible I should eat,&rdquo; repeated Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; said Lord Glenalmond. &ldquo;You have eaten
nothing to-day, and I venture to add, nothing yesterday.
There is no case that may not be made worse; this may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
a very disagreeable business, but if you were to fall sick and
die, it would be still more so, and for all concerned&mdash;for all
concerned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you must know all,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;Where did
you hear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the mart of scandal, in the Parliament House,&rdquo;
said Glenalmond. &ldquo;It runs riot below among the Bar and
the public, but it sifts up to us upon the Bench, and rumour
has some of her voices even in the divisions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carstairs returned at this moment, and rapidly laid out
a little supper; during which Lord Glenalmond spoke at
large and a little vaguely on indifferent subjects, so that it
might be rather said of him that he made a cheerful noise,
than that he contributed to human conversation; and
Archie sat upon the other side, not heeding him, brooding
over his wrongs and errors.</p>

<p>But so soon as the servant was gone, he broke forth
again at once. &ldquo;Who told my father? Who dared to tell
him? Could it have been you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it was not me,&rdquo; said the judge; &ldquo;although&mdash;to be
quite frank with you, after I had seen and warned you&mdash;it
might have been me. I believe it was Glenkindie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That shrimp!&rdquo; cried Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you say, that shrimp,&rdquo; returned my lord; &ldquo;although
really it is scarce a fitting mode of expression for one
of the senators of the College of Justice. We were hearing
the parties in a long, crucial case, before the fifteenth;
Creech was moving at some length for an infeftment; when
I saw Glenkindie lean forward to Hermiston with his hand
over his mouth and make him a secret communication. No
one could have guessed its nature from your father; from
Glenkindie, yes, his malice sparked out of him a little grossly.
But your father, no. A man of granite. The next moment
he pounced upon Creech. &lsquo;Mr. Creech,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take
a look of that sasine,&rsquo; and for thirty minutes after,&rdquo; said
Glenalmond, with a smile, &ldquo;Messrs. Creech and Co. were
fighting a pretty uphill battle, which resulted, I need hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
add, in their total rout. The case was dismissed. No, I
doubt if ever I heard Hermiston better inspired. He was
literally rejoicing <i>in apicibus juris</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archie was able to endure no longer. He thrust his
plate away and interrupted the deliberate and insignificant
stream of talk. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have made a fool of
myself, if I have not made something worse. Do you judge
between us&mdash;judge between a father and a son. I can
speak to you; it is not like ... I will tell you what I feel
and what I mean to do; and you shall be the judge,&rdquo; he
repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I decline jurisdiction,&rdquo; said Glenalmond, with extreme
seriousness. &ldquo;But, my dear boy, if it will do you any good
to talk, and if it will interest you at all to hear what I may
choose to say when I have heard you, I am quite at your
command. Let an old man say it, for once, and not need
to blush: I love you like a son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There came a sudden sharp sound in Archie&rsquo;s throat.
&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and there it is! Love! Like a son!
And how do you think I love my father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quietly, quietly,&rdquo; says my lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be very quiet,&rdquo; replied Archie. &ldquo;And I will be
baldly frank. I do not love my father; I wonder sometimes
if I do not hate him. There&rsquo;s my shame; perhaps my sin;
at least, and in the sight of God, not my fault. How was I to
love him? He has never spoken to me, never smiled upon
me; I do not think he ever touched me. You know the
way he talks? You do not talk so, yet you can sit and hear
him without shuddering, and I cannot. My soul is sick
when he begins with it; I could smite him in the mouth.
And all that&rsquo;s nothing. I was at the trial of this Jopp.
You were not there, but you must have heard him often;
the man&rsquo;s notorious for it, for being&mdash;look at my position!
he&rsquo;s my father and this is how I have to speak of him&mdash;notorious
for being a brute and cruel and a coward. Lord
Glenalmond, I give you my word, when I came out of that
Court, I longed to die&mdash;the shame of it was beyond my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>
strength: but I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he rose from his seat and began
to pace the room in a disorder. &ldquo;Well, who am I? A
boy, who have never been tried, have never done anything
except this twopenny impotent folly with my father. But
I tell you, my lord, and I know myself, I am at least that
kind of a man&mdash;or that kind of a boy, if you prefer it&mdash;that
I could die in torments rather than that any one should
suffer as that scoundrel suffered. Well, and what have I
done? I see it now. I have made a fool of myself, as
I said in the beginning; and I have gone back, and asked
my father&rsquo;s pardon, and placed myself wholly in his hands&mdash;and
he has sent me to Hermiston,&rdquo; with a wretched smile,
&ldquo;for life, I suppose&mdash;and what can I say? he strikes me
as having done quite right, and let me off better than I had
deserved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor, dear boy!&rdquo; observed Glenalmond. &ldquo;My
poor, dear and, if you will allow me to say so, very foolish
boy! You are only discovering where you are; to one of
your temperament, or of mine, a painful discovery. The
world was not made for us; it was made for ten hundred
millions of men, all different from each other and from us;
there&rsquo;s no royal road there, we just have to sclamber and
tumble. Don&rsquo;t think that I am at all disposed to be surprised;
don&rsquo;t suppose that I ever think of blaming you;
indeed I rather admire! But there fall to be offered one
or two observations on the case which occur to me and
which (if you will listen to them dispassionately) may be
the means of inducing you to view the matter more calmly.
First of all, I cannot acquit you of a good deal of what is
called intolerance. You seem to have been very much
offended because your father talks a little sculduddery
after dinner, which it is perfectly licit for him to do, and
which (although I am not very fond of it myself) appears
to be entirely an affair of taste. Your father, I scarcely
like to remind you, since it is so trite a commonplace, is
older than yourself. At least, he is <i>major</i> and <i>sui juris</i>, and
may please himself in the matter of his conversation. And,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span>
do you know, I wonder if he might not have as good an
answer against you and me? We say we sometimes find
him <i>coarse</i>, but I suspect he might retort that he finds us
always dull. Perhaps a relevant exception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He beamed on Archie, but no smile could be elicited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; proceeded the judge, &ldquo;for &lsquo;Archibald on
Capital Punishment.&rsquo; This is a very plausible academic
opinion; of course I do not and I cannot hold it; but that&rsquo;s
not to say that many able and excellent persons have not
done so in the past. Possibly, in the past also, I may have
a little dipped myself in the same heresy. My third client,
or possibly my fourth, was the means of a return in my
opinions. I never saw the man I more believed in; I would
have put my hand in the fire; I would have gone to the
cross for him; and when it came to trial he was gradually
pictured before me, by undeniable probation, in the light
of so gross, so cold-blooded, and so black-hearted a villain,
that I had a mind to have cast my brief upon the table. I
was then boiling against the man with even a more tropical
temperature than I had been boiling for him. But I said
to myself: &lsquo;No, you have taken up his case; and because
you have changed your mind it must not be suffered to let
drop. All that rich tide of eloquence that you prepared
last night with so much enthusiasm is out of place, and yet
you must not desert him, you must say something.&rsquo; So I
said something, and I got him off. It made my reputation.
But an experience of that kind is formative. A man must
not bring his passions to the Bar&mdash;or to the Bench,&rdquo; he
added.</p>

<p>The story had slightly rekindled Archie&rsquo;s interest. &ldquo;I
could never deny,&rdquo; he began&mdash;&ldquo;I mean I can conceive
that some men would be better dead. But who are we to
know all the springs of God&rsquo;s unfortunate creatures? Who
are we to trust ourselves where it seems that God Himself
must think twice before He treads, and to do it with
delight? Yes, with delight. <i>Tigris ut aspera</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not a pleasant spectacle,&rdquo; said Glenalmond.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
&ldquo;And yet, do you know, I think somehow a great
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a long talk with him to-night,&rdquo; said Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was supposing so,&rdquo; said Glenalmond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he struck me&mdash;I cannot deny that he struck me
as something very big,&rdquo; pursued the son. &ldquo;Yes, he is big.
He never spoke about himself; only about me. I suppose
I admired him. The dreadful part&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we did not talk about that,&rdquo; interrupted
Glenalmond. &ldquo;You know it very well, it cannot in any
way help that you should brood upon it, and I sometimes
wonder whether you and I&mdash;who are a pair of sentimentalists&mdash;are
quite good judges of plain men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo; asked Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Fair</i> judges, I mean,&rdquo; replied Glenalmond. &ldquo;Can we
be just to them? Do we not ask too much? There was
a word of yours just now that impressed me a little when
you asked me who we were to know all the springs of
God&rsquo;s unfortunate creatures. You applied that, as I understood,
to capital cases only. But does it&mdash;I ask myself&mdash;does
it not apply all through? Is it any less difficult to
judge of a good man or of a half-good man, than of the
worst criminal at the bar? And may not each have
relevant excuses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but we do not talk of punishing the good,&rdquo; cried
Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we do not talk of it,&rdquo; said Glenalmond. &ldquo;But
I think we do it. Your father, for instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I have punished him?&rdquo; cried Archie.</p>

<p>Lord Glenalmond bowed his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I have,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;And the worst is,
I think he feels it! How much, who can tell, with such a
being? But I think he does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am sure of it,&rdquo; said Glenalmond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he spoken to you, then?&rdquo; cried Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O no,&rdquo; replied the judge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you honestly,&rdquo; said Archie, &ldquo;I want to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
it up to him. I will go, I have already pledged myself to
go, to Hermiston. That was to him. And now I pledge
myself to you, in the sight of God, that I will close my
mouth on capital punishment and all other subjects where
our views may clash, for&mdash;how long shall I say? when shall
I have sense enough?&mdash;ten years. Is that well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said my lord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as it goes,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;It is enough as regards
myself, it is to lay down enough of my conceit. But
as regards him, whom I have publicly insulted? What am
I to do to him? How do you pay attentions to a&mdash;an Alp
like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only in one way,&rdquo; replied Glenalmond. &ldquo;Only by
obedience, punctual, prompt, and scrupulous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I promise that he shall have it,&rdquo; answered Archie.
&ldquo;I offer you my hand in pledge of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I take your hand as a solemnity,&rdquo; replied the
judge. &ldquo;God bless you, my dear, and enable you to keep
your promise. God guide you in the true way, and spare
your days, and preserve to you your honest heart.&rdquo; At
that, he kissed the young man upon the forehead in a gracious,
distant, antiquated way; and instantly launched, with
a marked change of voice, into another subject. &ldquo;And now,
let us replenish the tankard; and I believe, if you will try
my Cheddar again, you would find you had a better appetite.
The Court has spoken, and the case is dismissed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there is one thing I must say,&rdquo; cried Archie. &ldquo;I
must say it in justice to himself. I know&mdash;I believe faithfully,
slavishly, after our talk&mdash;he will never ask me anything
unjust. I am proud to feel it, that we have that
much in common, I am proud to say it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The judge, with shining eyes, raised his tankard. &ldquo;And
I think perhaps that we might permit ourselves a toast,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;I should like to propose the health of a man
very different from me and very much my superior&mdash;a man
from whom I have often differed, who has often (in the
trivial expression) rubbed me the wrong way, but whom I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span>
have never ceased to respect and, I may add, to be not a
little afraid of. Shall I give you his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord Justice-Clerk, Lord Hermiston,&rdquo; said Archie,
almost with gaiety; and the pair drank the toast deeply.</p>

<p>It was not precisely easy to re-establish, after these
emotional passages, the natural flow of conversation. But
the judge eked out what was wanting with kind looks, produced
his snuff-box (which was very rarely seen) to fill in
a pause, and at last, despairing of any further social success,
was upon the point of getting down a book to read a favourite
passage, when there came a rather startling summons at
the front door, and Carstairs ushered in my Lord Glenkindie,
hot from a midnight supper. I am not aware that Glenkindie
was ever a beautiful object, being short, and gross-bodied,
and with an expression of sensuality comparable
to a bear&rsquo;s. At that moment, coming in hissing from many
potations, with a flushed countenance and blurred eyes,
he was strikingly contrasted with the tall, pale, kingly
figure of Glenalmond. A rush of confused thought came
over Archie&mdash;of shame that this was one of his father&rsquo;s
elect friends; of pride, that at the least of it Hermiston
could carry his liquor; and last of all, of rage, that he should
have here under his eyes the man that had betrayed him.
And then that too passed away; and he sat quiet, biding
his opportunity.</p>

<p>The tipsy senator plunged at once into an explanation
with Glenalmond. There was a point reserved yesterday,
he had been able to make neither head nor tail of it, and
seeing lights in the house, he had just dropped in for a
glass of porter&mdash;and at this point he became aware of the
third person. Archie saw the cod&rsquo;s mouth and the blunt
lips of Glenkindie gape at him for a moment, and the recognition
twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What? is this possibly you,
Don Quickshot? And how are ye? And how&rsquo;s your
father? And what&rsquo;s all this we hear of you? It seems
you&rsquo;re a most extraordinary leveller, by all tales. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
king, no parliaments, and your gorge rises at the macers,
worthy men! Hoot, toot! Dear, dear me! Your father&rsquo;s
son too! Most rideeculous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archie was on his feet, flushing a little at the reappearance
of his unhappy figure of speech, but perfectly self-possessed.
&ldquo;My lord&mdash;and you, Lord Glenalmond, my
dear friend,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;this is a happy chance for me, that
I can make my confession and offer my apologies to two of
you at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I don&rsquo;t know about that. Confession? It&rsquo;ll
be judeecial, my young friend,&rdquo; cried the jocular Glenkindie.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid to listen to ye. Think if ye were to make
me a coanvert!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you would allow me, my lord,&rdquo; returned Archie,
&ldquo;what I have to say is very serious to me; and be pleased
to be humorous after I am gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, I&rsquo;ll hear nothing against the macers!&rdquo;
put in the incorrigible Glenkindie.</p>

<p>But Archie continued as though he had not spoken. &ldquo;I
have played, both yesterday and to-day, a part for which
I can only offer the excuse of youth. I was so unwise as
to go to an execution; it seems I made a scene at the
gallows; not content with which, I spoke the same night
in a college society against capital punishment. This is
the extent of what I have done, and in case you hear more
alleged against me, I protest my innocence. I have expressed
my regret already to my father, who is so good as
to pass my conduct over&mdash;in a degree, and upon the condition
that I am to leave my law studies.&rdquo; ...</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>WINTER ON THE MOORS</h5>

<p class="center1">1. <i>At Hermiston</i></p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> road to Hermiston runs for a great part of the way
up the valley of a stream, a favourite with anglers and with
midges, full of falls and pools, and shaded by willows and
natural woods of birch. Here and there, but at great distances,
a byway branches off, and a gaunt farmhouse may
be descried above in a fold of the hill; but the more part of
the time, the road would be quite empty of passage and the
hills of habitation. Hermiston parish is one of the least
populous in Scotland; and, by the time you came that
length, you would scarce be surprised at the inimitable
smallness of the kirk, a dwarfish, ancient place seated for
fifty, and standing in a green by the burn-side among two-score
gravestones. The manse close by, although no more
than a cottage, is surrounded by the brightness of a flower-garden
and the straw roofs of bees; and the whole colony,
kirk and manse, garden and graveyard, finds harbourage
in a grove of rowans, and is all the year round in a great
silence broken only by the drone of the bees, the tinkle of
the burn, and the bell on Sundays. A mile beyond the kirk
the road leaves the valley by a precipitous ascent, and brings
you a little after to the place of Hermiston, where it comes
to an end in the back-yard before the coach-house. All
beyond and about is the great field of the hills; the plover,
the curlew, and the lark cry there; the wind blows as it
blows in a ship&rsquo;s rigging, hard and cold and pure; and the
hill-tops huddle one behind another, like a herd of cattle,
into the sunset.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span></p>

<p>The house was sixty years old, unsightly, comfortable;
a farmyard and a kitchen-garden on the left, with a fruit
wall where little hard green pears came to their maturity
about the end of October.</p>

<p>The policy (as who should say the park) was of some
extent, but very ill reclaimed; heather and moor-fowl had
crossed the boundary wall and spread and roosted within;
and it would have tasked a landscape gardener to say where
policy ended and unpolicied nature began. My lord had
been led by the influence of Mr. Sheriff Scott into a considerable
design of planting; many acres were accordingly set
out with fir, and the little feathery besoms gave a false
scale and lent a strange air of a toy-shop to the moors. A
great, rooty sweetness of bogs was in the air, and at all
seasons an infinite melancholy piping of hill birds. Standing
so high and with so little shelter, it was a cold, exposed
house, splashed by showers, drenched by continuous rains
that made the gutters to spout, beaten upon and buffeted
by all the winds of heaven; and the prospect would be often
black with tempest, and often white with the snows of
winter. But the house was wind and weather proof, the
hearths were kept bright, and the rooms pleasant with live
fires of peat; and Archie might sit of an evening and hear
the squalls bugle on the moorland, and watch the fire prosper
in the earthy fuel, and the smoke winding up the chimney,
and drink deep of the pleasures of shelter.</p>

<p>Solitary as the place was, Archie did not want neighbours.
Every night, if he chose, he might go down to the
manse and share a &ldquo;brewst&rdquo; of toddy with the minister&mdash;a
hare-brained ancient gentleman, long and light and still
active, though his knees were loosened with age, and his
voice broke continually in childish trebles&mdash;and his lady
wife, a heavy, comely dame, without a word to say for
herself beyond good-even and good-day. Harum-scarum,
clodpole young lairds of the neighbourhood paid him the
compliment of a visit. Young Hay of Romanes rode down
to call, on his crop-eared pony; young Pringle of Drumanno
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
came up on his bony grey. Hay remained on the hospitable
field, and must be carried to bed; Pringle got somehow
to his saddle about 3 <span class="sc">a.m.</span>, and (as Archie stood with the
lamp on the upper doorstep) lurched, uttered a senseless
view-holloa, and vanished out of the small circle of illumination
like a wraith. Yet a minute or two longer the clatter
of his break-neck flight was audible, then it was cut off by
the intervening steepness of the hill; and again, a great
while after, the renewed beating of phantom horsehoofs,
far in the valley of the Hermiston, showed that the horse at
least, if not his rider, was still on the homeward way.</p>

<p>There was a Tuesday club at the &ldquo;Crosskeys&rdquo; in Crossmichael,
where the young bloods of the countryside congregated
and drank deep on a percentage of the expense,
so that he was left gainer who should have drunk the most.
Archie had no great mind to this diversion, but he took it
like a duty laid upon him, went with a decent regularity,
did his manfullest with the liquor, held up his head in the
local jests, and got home again and was able to put up his
horse, to the admiration of Kirstie and the lass that helped
her. He dined at Driffel, supped at Windielaws. He went
to the new year&rsquo;s ball at Huntsfield and was made welcome,
and thereafter rode to hounds with my Lord Muirfell, upon
whose name, as that of a legitimate Lord of Parliament, in
a work so full of Lords of Session, my pen should pause
reverently. Yet the same fate attended him here as in
Edinburgh. The habit of solitude tends to perpetuate
itself, and an austerity of which he was quite unconscious,
and a pride which seemed arrogance, and perhaps was
chiefly shyness, discouraged and offended his new companions.
Hay did not return more than twice, Pringle
never at all, and there came a time when Archie even desisted
from the Tuesday Club, and became in all things&mdash;what
he had had the name of almost from the first&mdash;the
Recluse of Hermiston. High-nosed Miss Pringle of Drumanno
and high-stepping Miss Marshall of the Mains were
understood to have had a difference of opinion about him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>208</span>
the day after the ball&mdash;he was none the wiser, he could not
suppose himself to be remarked by these entrancing ladies.
At the ball itself my Lord Muirfell&rsquo;s daughter, the Lady
Flora, spoke to him twice, and the second time with a touch
of appeal, so that her colour rose and her voice trembled
a little in his ear, like a passing grace in music. He stepped
back with a heart on fire, coldly and not ungracefully excused
himself, and a little after watched her dancing with
young Drumanno of the empty laugh, and was harrowed at
the sight, and raged to himself that this was a world in
which it was given to Drumanno to please, and to himself
only to stand aside and envy. He seemed excluded, as of
right, from the favour of such society&mdash;seemed to extinguish
mirth wherever he came, and was quick to feel the
wound, and desist, and retire into solitude. If he had but
understood the figure he presented, and the impression he
made on these bright eyes and tender hearts; if he had but
guessed that the Recluse of Hermiston, young, graceful, well
spoken, but always cold, stirred the maidens of the county
with the charm of Byronism when Byronism was new, it
may be questioned whether his destiny might not even yet
have been modified. It may be questioned, and I think it
should be doubted. It was in his horoscope to be parsimonious
of pain to himself, or of the chance of pain, even to
the avoidance of any opportunity of pleasure; to have a
Roman sense of duty, an instinctive aristocracy of manners
and taste; to be the son of Adam Weir and Jean Rutherford.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center1">2. <i>Kirstie</i></p>

<p>Kirstie was now over fifty, and might have sat to a
sculptor. Long of limb, and still light of foot, deep-breasted,
robust-loined, her golden hair not yet mingled
with any trace of silver, the years had but caressed and
embellished her. By the lines of a rich and vigorous
maternity, she seemed destined to be the bride of heroes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
and the mother of their children; and behold, by the iniquity
of fate, she had passed through her youth alone, and
drew near to the confines of age, a childless woman. The
tender ambitions that she had received at birth had been,
by time and disappointment, diverted into a certain barren
zeal of industry and fury of interference. She carried her
thwarted ardours into housework, she washed floors with
her empty heart. If she could not win the love of one with
love, she must dominate all by her temper. Hasty, wordy,
and wrathful, she had a drawn quarrel with most of her
neighbours, and with the others not much more than armed
neutrality. The grieve&rsquo;s wife had been &ldquo;sneisty&rdquo;; the
sister of the gardener who kept house for him had shown
herself &ldquo;upsitten&rdquo;; and she wrote to Lord Hermiston
about once a year demanding the discharge of the offenders,
and justifying the demand by much wealth of detail. For
it must not be supposed that the quarrel rested with the
wife and did not take in the husband also&mdash;or with the
gardener&rsquo;s sister, and did not speedily include the gardener
himself. As the upshot of all this petty quarrelling and
intemperate speech, she was practically excluded (like a
lightkeeper on his tower) from the comforts of human association;
except with her own indoor drudge, who, being
but a lassie and entirely at her mercy, must submit to the
shifty weather of &ldquo;the mistress&rsquo;s&rdquo; moods without complaint,
and be willing to take buffets or caresses according
to the temper of the hour. To Kirstie, thus situate and in
the Indian summer of her heart, which was slow to submit
to age, the gods sent this equivocal good thing of Archie&rsquo;s
presence. She had known him in the cradle and paddled
him when he misbehaved; and yet, as she had not so much
as set eyes on him since he was eleven and had his last
serious illness, the tall, slender, refined, and rather melancholy
young gentleman of twenty came upon her with the
shock of a new acquaintance. He was &ldquo;Young Hermiston,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the laird himsel&rsquo;&rdquo;: he had an air of distinctive
superiority, a cold straight glance of his black eyes, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
abashed the woman&rsquo;s tantrums in the beginning, and therefore
the possibility of any quarrel was excluded. He was
new, and therefore immediately aroused her curiosity; he
was reticent, and kept it awake. And lastly he was dark
and she fair, and he was male and she female, the everlasting
fountains of interest.</p>

<p>Her feeling partook of the loyalty of a clanswoman, the
hero-worship of a maiden aunt, and the idolatry due to a
god. No matter what he had asked of her, ridiculous or
tragic, she would have done it and joyed to do it. Her
passion, for it was nothing less, entirely filled her. It was
a rich physical pleasure to make his bed or light his lamp
for him when he was absent, to pull off his wet boots or
wait on him at dinner when he returned. A young man
who should have so doted on the idea, moral and physical,
of any woman, might be properly described as being in
love, head and heels, and would have behaved himself
accordingly. But Kirstie&mdash;though her heart leaped at
his coming footsteps&mdash;though, when he patted her shoulder,
her face brightened for the day&mdash;had not a hope or thought
beyond the present moment and its perpetuation to the end
of time. Till the end of time she would have had nothing
altered, but still continue delightedly to serve her idol, and
be repaid (say twice in the month) with a clap on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>I have said her heart leaped&mdash;it is the accepted phrase.
But rather, when she was alone in any chamber of the
house, and heard his foot passing on the corridors, something
in her bosom rose slowly until her breath was suspended,
and as slowly fell again with a deep sigh, when the
steps had passed and she was disappointed of her eyes&rsquo;
desire. This perpetual hunger and thirst of his presence
kept her all day on the alert. When he went forth at morning,
she would stand and follow him with admiring looks.
As it grew late and drew to the time of his return, she would
steal forth to a corner of the policy wall and be seen standing
there sometimes by the hour together, gazing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
shaded eyes, waiting the exquisite and barren pleasure of
his view a mile off on the mountains. When at night she
had trimmed and gathered the fire, turned down his bed,
and laid out his night-gear&mdash;when there was no more to be
done for the king&rsquo;s pleasure, but to remember him fervently
in her usually very tepid prayers, and go to bed brooding
upon his perfections, his future career, and what she should
give him the next day for dinner&mdash;there still remained before
her one more opportunity; she was still to take in the tray
and say good-night. Sometimes Archie would glance up
from his book with a preoccupied nod and a perfunctory
salutation which was in truth a dismissal; sometimes&mdash;and
by degrees more often&mdash;the volume would be laid aside,
he would meet her coming with a look of relief; and the
conversation would be engaged, last out the supper, and
be prolonged till the small hours by the waning fire. It
was no wonder that Archie was fond of company after his
solitary days; and Kirstie, upon her side, exerted all the
arts of her vigorous nature to ensnare his attention. She
would keep back some piece of news during dinner to be
fired off with the entrance of the supper tray, and form as
it were the <i>lever de rideau</i> of the evening&rsquo;s entertainment.
Once he had heard her tongue wag, she made sure of the
result. From one subject to another she moved by insidious
transitions, fearing the least silence, fearing almost to
give him time for an answer lest it should slip into a hint of
separation. Like so many people of her class, she was a
brave narrator; her place was on the hearthrug and she
made it a rostrum, miming her stories as she told them, fitting
them with vital detail, spinning them out with endless
&ldquo;quo&rsquo; he&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;quo&rsquo; she&rsquo;s,&rdquo; her voice sinking into a
whisper over the supernatural or the horrific; until she
would suddenly spring up in affected surprise, and pointing
to the clock, &ldquo;Mercy, Mr. Archie!&rdquo; she would say,
&ldquo;whatten a time o&rsquo; night is this of it! God forgive me for
a daft wife!&rdquo; So it befell, by good management, that she
was not only the first to begin these nocturnal conversations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
but invariably the first to break them off; so she
managed to retire and not to be dismissed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center1">3. <i>A Border Family</i></p>

<p>Such an unequal intimacy has never been uncommon
in Scotland, where the clan spirit survives; where the
servant tends to spend her life in the same service, a help-meet
at first, then a tyrant, and at last a pensioner; where,
besides, she is not necessarily destitute of the pride of birth,
but is, perhaps, like Kirstie, a connection of her master&rsquo;s,
and at least knows the legend of her own family, and may
count kinship with some illustrious dead. For that is the
mark of the Scot of all classes: that he stands in an attitude
towards the past unthinkable to Englishmen, and remembers
and cherishes the memory of his forebears, good or bad;
and there burns alive in him a sense of identity with the
dead even to the twentieth generation. No more characteristic
instance could be found than in the family of Kirstie
Elliott. They were all, and Kirstie the first of all, ready
and eager to pour forth the particulars of their genealogy,
embellished with every detail that memory had handed
down or fancy fabricated; and, behold! from every ramification
of that tree there dangled a halter. The Elliotts
themselves have had a chequered history; but these
Elliotts deduced, besides, from three of the most unfortunate
of the border clans&mdash;the Nicksons, the Ellwalds, and
the Crozers. One ancestor after another might be seen
appearing a moment out of the rain and the hill mist upon
his furtive business, speeding home, perhaps, with a paltry
booty of lame horses and lean kine, or squealing and dealing
death in some moorland feud of the ferrets and the wild
cats. One after another closed his obscure adventures in
mid-air, triced up to the arm of the royal gibbet or the
Baron&rsquo;s dule-tree. For the rusty blunderbuss of Scots
criminal justice, which usually hurt nobody but jurymen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
became a weapon of precision for the Nicksons, the Ellwalds,
and the Crozers. The exhilaration of their exploits seemed
to haunt the memories of their descendants alone, and the
shame to be forgotten. Pride glowed in their bosoms to
publish their relationship to &ldquo;Andrew Ellwald of the
Laverockstanes, called &lsquo;Unchancy Dand,&rsquo; who was justifeed
wi&rsquo; seeven mair of the same name at Jeddart in the days of
King James the Sax.&rdquo; In all this tissue of crime and misfortune,
the Elliotts of Cauldstaneslap had one boast which
must appear legitimate: the males were gallows-birds,
born outlaws, petty thieves, and deadly brawlers; but,
according to the same tradition, the females were all chaste
and faithful. The power of ancestry on the character is
not limited to the inheritance of cells. If I buy ancestors
by the gross from the benevolence of Lyon King of Arms,
my grandson (if he is Scottish) will feel a quickening emulation
of their deeds. The men of the Elliotts were proud,
lawless, violent as of right, cherishing and prolonging a
tradition. In like manner with the women. And the
woman, essentially passionate and reckless, who crouched
on the rug, in the shine of the peat fire, telling these tales,
had cherished through life a wild integrity of virtue.</p>

<p>Her father Gilbert had been deeply pious, a savage
disciplinarian in the antique style, and withal a notorious
smuggler. &ldquo;I mind when I was a bairn getting mony a
skelp and being shoo&rsquo;d to bed like pou&rsquo;try,&rdquo; she would say.
&ldquo;That would be when the lads and their bit kegs were on
the road. We&rsquo;ve had the riffraff of two-three counties in
our kitchen, mony&rsquo;s the time, betwix&rsquo; the twelve and the
three; and their lanterns would be standing in the forecourt,
ay, a score o&rsquo; them at once. But there was nae ungodly
talk permitted at Cauldstaneslap; my faither was
a consistent man in walk and conversation; just let slip
an aith, and there was the door to ye! He had that zeal
for the Lord, it was a fair wonder to hear him pray, but the
faim&rsquo;ly has aye had a gift that way.&rdquo; This father was
twice married, once to a dark woman of the old Ellwald
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>
stock, by whom he had Gilbert, presently of Cauldstaneslap;
and, secondly, to the mother of Kirstie. &ldquo;He was an auld
man when he married her, a fell auld man wi&rsquo; a muckle
voice&mdash;you could hear him rowting from the top o&rsquo; the
Kye-skairs,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;but for her, it appears she was a
perfit wonder. It was gentle blood she had, Mr. Archie,
for it was your ain. The country-side gaed gyte about her
and her gowden hair. Mines is no to be mentioned wi&rsquo; it,
and there&rsquo;s few weemen has mair hair than what I have, or
yet a bonnier colour. Often would I tell my dear Miss
Jeannie&mdash;that was your mother, dear, she was cruel ta&rsquo;en
up about her hair, it was unco tender, ye see&mdash;&rsquo;Hoots, Miss
Jeannie,&rsquo; I would say, &lsquo;just fling your washes and your
French dentifrishes in the back o&rsquo; the fire, for that&rsquo;s the
place for them; and awa&rsquo; down to a burn side, and wash
yersel&rsquo; in cauld hill water, and dry your bonny hair in the
caller wind o&rsquo; the muirs, the way that my mother aye
washed hers, and that I have aye made it a practice to have
wishen mines&mdash;just you do what I tell ye, my dear, and ye&rsquo;ll
give me news of it! Ye&rsquo;ll have hair, and routh of hair, a
pigtail as thick&rsquo;s my arm,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and the bonniest colour
like the clear gowden guineas, so as the lads in kirk&rsquo;ll no
can keep their eyes off it!&rsquo; Weel, it lasted out her time,
puir thing! I cuttit a lock of it upon her corp that was
lying there sae cauld. I&rsquo;ll show it ye some of thir days if
ye&rsquo;re good. But, as I was sayin&rsquo;, my mither&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the death of the father there remained golden-haired
Kirstie, who took service with her distant kinsfolk,
the Rutherfords, and black-a-vised Gilbert, twenty years
older, who farmed the Cauldstaneslap, married, and begot
four sons between 1773 and 1784, and a daughter, like a
postscript, in &rsquo;97, the year of Camperdown and Cape St.
Vincent. It seemed it was a tradition in the family to
wind up with a belated girl. In 1804, at the age of sixty,
Gilbert met an end that might be called heroic. He was
due home from market any time from eight at night till
five in the morning, and in any condition from the quarrelsome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
to the speechless, for he maintained to that age the
goodly customs of the Scots farmer. It was known on this
occasion that he had a good bit of money to bring home;
the word had gone round loosely. The laird had shown his
guineas, and if anybody had but noticed it, there was an
ill-looking, vagabond crew, the scum of Edinburgh, that
drew out of the market long ere it was dusk and took the
hill-road by Hermiston, where it was not to be believed that
they had lawful business. One of the country-side, one
Dickieson, they took with them to be their guide, and dear
he paid for it! Of a sudden, in the ford of the Broken
Dykes, this vermin clan fell on the laird, six to one, and him
three parts asleep, having drunk hard. But it is ill to catch
an Elliott. For a while, in the night and the black water
that was deep as to his saddle-girths, he wrought with his
staff like a smith at his stithy, and great was the sound of
oaths and blows. With that the ambuscade was burst, and
he rode for home with a pistol-ball in him, three knife
wounds, the loss of his front teeth, a broken rib and bridle,
and a dying horse. That was a race with death that the
laird rode. In the mirk night, with his broken bridle and
his head swimming, he dug his spurs to the rowels in the
horse&rsquo;s side, and the horse, that was even worse off than
himself, the poor creature! screamed out like a person as he
went, so that the hills echoed with it, and the folks at Cauldstaneslap
got to their feet about the table and looked at
each other with white faces. The horse fell dead at the yard
gate, the laird won the length of the house and fell there on
the threshold. To the son that raised him he gave the bag
of money. &ldquo;Hae,&rdquo; said he. All the way up the thieves
had seemed to him to be at his heels, but now the hallucination
left him&mdash;he saw them again in the place of the
ambuscade&mdash;and the thirst of vengeance seized on his dying
mind. Raising himself and pointing with an imperious
finger into the black night from which he had come, he
uttered the single command, &ldquo;Brocken Dykes,&rdquo; and fainted.
He had never been loved, but he had been feared in honour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>216</span>
At that sight, at that word, gasped out at them from a
toothless and bleeding mouth, the old Elliott spirit awoke
with a shout in the four sons. &ldquo;Wanting the hat,&rdquo; continues
my author, Kirstie, whom I but haltingly follow,
for she told this tale like one inspired, &ldquo;wanting guns, for
there wasna twa grains o&rsquo; pouder in the house, wi&rsquo; nae mair
weepons than their sticks into their hands, the fower o&rsquo;
them took the road. Only Hob, and that was the eldest,
hunkered at the door-sill where the blood had rin, fyled
his hand wi&rsquo; it, and haddit it up to Heeven in the way o&rsquo;
the auld Border aith. &lsquo;Hell shall have her ain again this
nicht!&rsquo; he raired, and rode forth upon his earrand.&rdquo; It was
three miles to Broken Dykes, down hill, and a sore road.
Kirstie had seen men from Edinburgh dismounting there
in plain day to lead their horses. But the four brothers
rode it as if Auld Hornie were behind and Heaven in front.
Come to the ford, and there was Dickieson. By all tales,
he was not dead, but breathed and reared upon his elbow,
and cried out to them for help. It was at a graceless face
that he asked mercy. As soon as Hob saw, by the glint of
the lantern, the eyes shining and the whiteness of the teeth
in the man&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;ye hae your
teeth, hae ye?&rdquo; and rode his horse to and fro upon that
human remnant. Beyond that, Dandie must dismount
with the lantern to be their guide; he was the youngest
son, scarce twenty at the time. &ldquo;A&rsquo; nicht long they gaed
in the wet heath and jennipers, and whaur they gaed they
neither knew nor cared, but just followed the bluid-stains
and the footprints o&rsquo; their faither&rsquo;s murderers. And a&rsquo;
nicht Dandie had his nose to the grund like a tyke, and the
ithers followed and spak&rsquo; naething, neither black nor white.
There was nae noise to be heard, but just the sough of the
swalled burns, and Hob, the dour yin, risping his teeth as
he gaed.&rdquo; With the first glint of the morning they saw
they were on the drove-road, and at that the four stopped
and had a dram to their breakfasts, for they knew that
Dand must have guided them right, and the rogues could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
but little ahead, hot foot for Edinburgh by the way of the
Pentland Hills. By eight o&rsquo;clock they had word of them&mdash;a
shepherd had seen four men &ldquo;uncoly mishandled&rdquo; go
by in the last hour. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s yin a piece,&rdquo; says Clem, and
swung his cudgel. &ldquo;Five o&rsquo; them!&rdquo; says Hob. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
death, but the faither was a man! And him drunk!&rdquo; And
then there befell them what my author termed &ldquo;a sair
misbegowk,&rdquo; for they were overtaken by a posse of mounted
neighbours come to aid in the pursuit. Four sour faces
looked on the reinforcement. &ldquo;The Deil&rsquo;s broughten
you!&rdquo; said Clem, and they rode thenceforward in the rear
of the party with hanging heads. Before ten they had
found and secured the rogues, and by three of the afternoon,
as they rode up the Vennel with their prisoners, they were
aware of a concourse of people bearing in their midst something
that dripped. &ldquo;For the boady of the saxt,&rdquo; pursued
Kirstie, &ldquo;wi&rsquo; his head smashed like a hazel-nit, had been a&rsquo;
that nicht in the chairge o&rsquo; Hermiston Water, and it dunting
in on the stanes, and grunding it on the shallows, and flinging
the deid thing heels-ower-hurdie at the Fa&rsquo;s o&rsquo; Spango;
and in the first o&rsquo; the day, Tweed had got a hold o&rsquo; him and
carried him off like a wind, for it was uncoly swalled, and
raced wi&rsquo; him, bobbing under braesides, and was long playing
with the creature in the drumlie lynns under the castle,
and at the hinder end of all cuist him up on the sterling of
Crossmichael brig. Sae there they were a&rsquo;thegither at last
(for Dickieson had been brought in on a cart long syne), and
folk could see what mainner o&rsquo; man my brither had been
that had held his head again sax and saved the siller, and
him drunk!&rdquo; Thus died of honourable injuries and in the
savour of fame Gilbert Elliott of the Cauldstaneslap; but
his sons had scarce less glory out of the business. Their
savage haste, the skill with which Dand had found and
followed the trail, the barbarity to the wounded Dickieson
(which was like an open secret in the county), and the doom
which it was currently supposed they had intended for the
others, struck and stirred popular imagination. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>218</span>
century earlier the last of the minstrels might have fashioned
the last of the ballads out of that Homeric fight and chase;
but the spirit was dead, or had been reincarnated already
in Mr. Sheriff Scott, and the degenerate moorsmen must be
content to tell the tale in prose, and to make of the &ldquo;Four
Black Brothers&rdquo; a unit after the fashion of the &ldquo;Twelve
Apostles&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Three Musketeers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Robert, Gilbert, Clement, and Andrew&mdash;in the proper
Border diminutives, Hob, Gib, Clem, and Dand Elliott&mdash;these
ballad heroes, had much in common; in particular,
their high sense of the family and the family honour; but
they went diverse ways, and prospered and failed in different
businesses. According to Kirstie, &ldquo;they had a&rsquo; bees in
their bonnets but Hob.&rdquo; Hob the laird was, indeed, essentially
a decent man. An elder of the Kirk, nobody had
heard an oath upon his lips, save, perhaps, thrice or so at
the sheep-washing, since the chase of his father&rsquo;s murderers.
The figure he had shown on that eventful night disappeared
as if swallowed by a trap. He who had ecstatically dipped
his hand in the red blood, he who had ridden down Dickieson,
became, from that moment on, a stiff and rather graceless
model of the rustic proprieties; cannily profiting by the
high war prices, and yearly stowing away a little nest-egg
in the bank against calamity; approved of and sometimes
consulted by the greater lairds for the massive and placid
sense of what he said, when he could be induced to say anything;
and particularly valued by the minister, Mr. Torrance,
as a right-hand man in the parish, and a model to parents.
The transfiguration had been for the moment only; some
Barbarossa, some old Adam of our ancestors, sleeps in all of
us till the fit circumstance shall call it into action; and, for
as sober as he now seemed, Hob had given once for all the
measure of the devil that haunted him. He was married,
and, by reason of the effulgence of that legendary night,
was adored by his wife. He had a mob of little lusty, barefoot
children who marched in a caravan the long miles to
school, the stages of whose pilgrimage were marked by acts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
of spoliation and mischief, and who were qualified in the
country-side as &ldquo;fair pests.&rdquo; But in the house, if &ldquo;faither
was in,&rdquo; they were quiet as mice. In short, Hob moved
through life in a great peace&mdash;the reward of any one who
shall have killed his man, with any formidable and figurative
circumstance, in the midst of a country gagged and swaddled
with civilisation.</p>

<p>It was a current remark that the Elliotts were &ldquo;guid
and bad, like sanguishes&rdquo;; and certainly there was a
curious distinction, the men of business coming alternately
with the dreamers. The second brother, Gib, was a weaver
by trade, had gone out early into the world to Edinburgh,
and come home again with his wings singed. There was an
exaltation in his nature which had led him to embrace with
enthusiasm the principles of the French Revolution, and had
ended by bringing him under the hawse of my Lord Hermiston
in that furious onslaught of his upon the Liberals, which
sent Muir and Palmer into exile and dashed the party into
chaff. It was whispered that my lord, in his great scorn
for the movement, and prevailed upon a little by a sense
of neighbourliness, had given Gib a hint. Meeting him one
day in the Potterrow, my lord had stopped in front of him:
&ldquo;Gib, ye eediot,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this I hear of you?
Poalitics, poalitics, poalitics, weaver&rsquo;s poalitics, is the way
of it, I hear. If ye arena a&rsquo;thegither dozened with eediocy,
ye&rsquo;ll gang your ways back to Cauldstaneslap, and ca&rsquo; your
loom, and ca&rsquo; your loom, man!&rdquo; And Gilbert had taken
him at the word and returned, with an expedition almost to
be called flight, to the house of his father. The clearest
of his inheritance was that family gift of prayer of which
Kirstie had boasted; and the baffled politician now turned
his attention to religious matters&mdash;or, as others said, to
heresy and schism. Every Sunday morning he was in
Crossmichael, where he had gathered together, one by one,
a sect of about a dozen persons, who called themselves
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s Remnant of the True Faithful,&rdquo; or, for short, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
Remnant.&rdquo; To the profane they were known as &ldquo;Gib&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
Deils.&rdquo; Bailie Sweedie, a noted humorist in the town,
vowed that the proceedings always opened to the tune of
&ldquo;The Deil Fly Away with the Exciseman,&rdquo; and that the
sacrament was dispensed in the form of hot whisky-toddy;
both wicked hits at the evangelist, who had been suspected
of smuggling in his youth, and had been overtaken (as the
phrase went) on the streets of Crossmichael one Fair day.
It was known that every Sunday they prayed for a blessing
on the arms of Buonaparte. For this, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Remnant,&rdquo;
as they were &ldquo;skailing&rdquo; from the cottage that did duty for
a temple, had been repeatedly stoned by the bairns, and Gib
himself hooted by a squadron of Border volunteers in which
his own brother, Dand, rode in a uniform and with a drawn
sword. The &ldquo;Remnant&rdquo; were believed, besides, to be
&ldquo;antinomian in principle,&rdquo; which might otherwise have been
a serious charge, but the way public opinion then blew it
was quite swallowed up and forgotten in the scandal about
Buonaparte. For the rest, Gilbert had set up his loom in an
outhouse at Cauldstaneslap, where he laboured assiduously
six days of the week. His brothers, appalled by his political
opinions, and willing to avoid dissension in the household,
spoke but little to him; he less to them, remaining
absorbed in the study of the Bible and almost constant
prayer. The gaunt weaver was dry-nurse at Cauldstaneslap,
and the bairns loved him dearly. Except when he
was carrying an infant in his arms, he was rarely seen to
smile&mdash;as, indeed, there were few smilers in that family.
When his sister-in-law rallied him, and proposed that he
should get a wife and bairns of his own, since he was so fond
of them, &ldquo;I have no clearness of mind upon that point,&rdquo; he
would reply. If nobody called him in to dinner, he stayed
out. Mrs. Hob, a hard, unsympathetic woman, once tried
the experiment. He went without food all day, but at
dusk, as the light began to fail him, he came into the house
of his own accord, looking puzzled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a great gale
of prayer upon my speerit,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I canna mind sae
muckle&rsquo;s what I had for denner.&rdquo; The creed of God&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>221</span>
Remnant was justified in the life of its founder. &ldquo;And yet
I dinna ken,&rdquo; said Kirstie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s maybe no more stock-fish
than his neeghbours! He rode wi&rsquo; the rest o&rsquo; them,
and had a good stamach to the work, by a&rsquo; that I hear!
God&rsquo;s Remnant! The deil&rsquo;s clavers! There wasna muckle
Christianity in the way Hob guided Johnny Dickieson, at
the least of it; but Guid kens! Is he a Christian even? He
might be a Mahommedan or a Deevil or a Fireworshipper,
for what I ken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third brother had his name on a door-plate, no
less, in the city of Glasgow, &ldquo;Mr. Clement Elliott,&rdquo; as long
as your arm. In this case, that spirit of innovation which
had shown itself timidly in the case of Hob by the admission
of new manures, and which had run to waste with Gilbert in
subversive politics and heretical religions, bore useful fruit
in many ingenious mechanical improvements. In boyhood,
from his addiction to strange devices of sticks and
string, he had been counted the most eccentric of the family.
But that was all by now; and he was a partner of his firm,
and looked to die a bailie. He too had married, and was
rearing a plentiful family in the smoke and din of Glasgow;
he was wealthy, and could have bought out his brother, the
cock-laird, six times over, it was whispered; and when he
slipped away to Cauldstaneslap for a well-earned holiday,
which he did as often as he was able, he astonished the
neighbours with his broadcloth, his beaver hat, and the ample
plies of his neckcloth. Though an eminently solid man at
bottom, after the pattern of Hob, he had contracted a certain
Glasgow briskness and <i>aplomb</i> which set him off. All the
other Elliotts were as lean as a rake, but Clement was
laying on fat, and he panted sorely when he must get
into his boots. Dand said, chuckling: &ldquo;Ay, Clem has the
elements of a corporation.&rdquo; &ldquo;A provost and corporation,&rdquo;
returned Clem. And his readiness was much
admired.</p>

<p>The fourth brother, Dand, was a shepherd to his trade,
and by starts, when he could bring his mind to it, excelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
in the business. Nobody could train a dog like Dandie;
nobody, through the peril of great storms in the winter
time, could do more gallantly. But if his dexterity were
exquisite, his diligence was but fitful; and he served his
brother for bed and board, and a trifle of pocket-money
when he asked for it. He loved money well enough, knew
very well how to spend it, and could make a shrewd bargain
when he liked. But he preferred a vague knowledge
that he was well to windward to any counted coins in the
pocket; he felt himself richer so. Hob would expostulate:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an amature herd.&rdquo; Dand would reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep
your sheep to you when I&rsquo;m so minded, but I&rsquo;ll keep my
liberty too. Thir&rsquo;s no man can coandescend on what I&rsquo;m
worth.&rdquo; Clem would expound to him the miraculous
results of compound interest, and recommend investments.
&ldquo;Ay, man?&rdquo; Dand would say; &ldquo;and do you think, if I
took Hob&rsquo;s siller, that I wouldna drink it or wear it on the
lassies? And, anyway, my kingdom is no of this world.
Either I&rsquo;m a poet or else I&rsquo;m nothing.&rdquo; Clem would remind
him of old age. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll die young, like Robbie Burns,&rdquo; he
would say stoutly. No question but he had a certain accomplishment
in minor verse. His &ldquo;Hermiston Burn,&rdquo; with
its pretty refrain&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;I love to gang thinking whaur ye gang linking,</p>
      <p class="i3">Hermiston burn, in the howe&rdquo;;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">his &ldquo;Auld, auld Elliotts, clay-cauld Elliotts, dour, bauld
Elliotts of auld,&rdquo; and his really fascinating piece about the
Praying Weaver&rsquo;s Stone, had gained him in the neighbourhood
the reputation, still possible in Scotland, of a local
bard; and, though not printed himself, he was recognised
by others who were and who had become famous. Walter
Scott owed to Dandie the text of the &ldquo;Raid of Wearie&rdquo; in
the &ldquo;Minstrelsy&rdquo;; and made him welcome at his house,
and appreciated his talents, such as they were, with all his
usual generosity. The Ettrick Shepherd was his sworn
crony; they would meet, drink to excess, roar out their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
lyrics in each other&rsquo;s faces, and quarrel and make it up again
till bedtime. And besides these recognitions, almost to be
called official, Dandie was made welcome for the sake
of his gift through the farmhouses of several contiguous
dales, and was thus exposed to manifold temptations which
he rather sought than fled. He had figured on the stool of
repentance, for once fulfilling to the letter the tradition of
his hero and model. His humorous verses to Mr. Torrance
on that occasion&mdash;&ldquo;Kenspeckle here my lane I stand&rdquo;&mdash;unfortunately
too indelicate for further citation, ran
through the country like a fiery cross; they were recited,
quoted, paraphrased, and laughed over as far away as Dumfries
on the one hand and Dunbar on the other.</p>

<p>These four brothers were united by a close bond, the bond
of that mutual admiration&mdash;or rather mutual hero-worship&mdash;which
is so strong among the members of secluded
families who have much ability and little culture. Even
the extremes admired each other. Hob, who had as much
poetry as the tongs, professed to find pleasure in Dand&rsquo;s
verses; Clem, who had no more religion than Claverhouse,
nourished a heartfelt, at least an open-mouthed, admiration
of Gib&rsquo;s prayers; and Dandie followed with relish the rise
of Clem&rsquo;s fortunes. Indulgence followed hard on the heels
of admiration. The laird, Clem, and Dand, who were
Tories and patriots of the hottest quality, excused to themselves,
with a certain bashfulness, the radical and revolutionary
heresies of Gib. By another division of the family,
the laird, Clem, and Gib, who were men exactly virtuous,
swallowed the dose of Dand&rsquo;s irregularities as a kind of
clog or drawback in the mysterious providence of God affixed
to bards, and distinctly probative of poetical genius. To
appreciate the simplicity of their mutual admiration it was
necessary to hear Clem, arrived upon one of his visits, and
dealing in a spirit of continuous irony with the affairs
and personalities of that great city of Glasgow where he
lived and transacted business. The various personages,
ministers of the church, municipal officers, mercantile big-wigs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
whom he had occasion to introduce, were all alike denigrated,
all served but as reflectors to cast back a flattering
side-light on the house of Cauldstaneslap. The Provost, for
whom Clem by exception entertained a measure of respect,
he would liken to Hob. &ldquo;He minds me o&rsquo; the laird there,&rdquo;
he would say. &ldquo;He has some of Hob&rsquo;s grand, whunstane
sense, and the same way with him of steiking his mouth
when he&rsquo;s no very pleased.&rdquo; And Hob, all unconscious,
would draw down his upper lip and produce, as if for comparison,
the formidable grimace referred to. The unsatisfactory
incumbent of St. Enoch&rsquo;s Kirk was thus briefly dismissed:
&ldquo;If he had but twa fingers o&rsquo; Gib&rsquo;s, he would
waken them up.&rdquo; And Gib, honest man! would look down
and secretly smile. Clem was a spy whom they had sent out
into the world of men. He had come back with the good
news that there was nobody to compare with the Four Black
Brothers, no position that they would not adorn, no official
that it would not be well they should replace, no interest of
mankind, secular or spiritual, which would not immediately
bloom under their supervision. The excuse of their folly
is in two words: scarce the breadth of a hair divided them
from the peasantry. The measure of their sense is this:
that these symposia of rustic vanity were kept entirely
within the family, like some secret ancestral practice. To
the world their serious faces were never deformed by the
suspicion of any simper of self-contentment. Yet it was
known. &ldquo;They hae a guid pride o&rsquo; themsel&rsquo;s!&rdquo; was the
word in the country-side.</p>

<p>Lastly, in a Border story, there should be added their
&ldquo;two-names.&rdquo; Hob was The Laird. &ldquo;Roy ne puis, prince
ne daigne&rdquo;; he was the laird of Cauldstaneslap&mdash;say fifty
acres&mdash;<i>ipsissimus</i>. Clement was Mr. Elliott, as upon his
door-plate, the earlier Dafty having been discarded as no
longer applicable, and indeed only a reminder of misjudgment
and the imbecility of the public; and the youngest,
in honour of his perpetual wanderings, was known by the
sobriquet of Randy Dand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span></p>

<p>It will be understood that not all this information was
communicated by the aunt, who had too much of the family
failing herself to appreciate it thoroughly in others. But as
time went on, Archie began to observe an omission in the
family chronicle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there not a girl too?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay: Kirstie. She was named for me, or my grandmother
at least&mdash;it&rsquo;s the same thing,&rdquo; returned the aunt,
and went on again about Dand, whom she secretly preferred
by reason of his gallantries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what is your niece like?&rdquo; said Archie at the next
opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her? As black&rsquo;s your hat! But I dinna suppose she
would maybe be what you would ca&rsquo; <i>ill-looked</i> a&rsquo;thegither.
Na, she&rsquo;s a kind of a handsome jaud&mdash;a kind o&rsquo; gipsy,&rdquo; said
the aunt, who had two sets of scales for men and women&mdash;or
perhaps it would be more fair to say that she had three,
and the third and the most loaded was for girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How comes it that I never see her in church?&rdquo; said
Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed, and I believe she&rsquo;s in Glesgie with Clem and
his wife. A heap good she&rsquo;s like to get of it! I dinna say
for men folk, but where weemen folk are born, there let
them bide. Glory to God, I was never far&rsquo;er from here
than Crossmichael.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meanwhile it began to strike Archie as strange,
that while she thus sang the praises of her kinsfolk, and
manifestly relished their virtues and (I may say) their vices
like a thing creditable to herself, there should appear not
the least sign of cordiality between the house of Hermiston
and that of Cauldstaneslap. Going to church of a Sunday,
as the lady housekeeper stepped with her skirts kilted, three
tucks of her white petticoat showing below, and her best
India shawl upon her back (if the day were fine) in a pattern
of radiant dyes, she would sometimes overtake her relatives
preceding her more leisurely in the same direction. Gib of
course was absent: by skreigh of day he had been gone to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
Crossmichael and his fellow-heretics; but the rest of the
family would be seen marching in open order: Hob and
Dand, stiff-necked, straight-backed six-footers, with severe
dark faces, and their plaids about their shoulders; the
convoy of children scattering (in a state of high polish) on
the wayside, and every now and again collected by the shrill
summons of the mother; and the mother herself, by a
suggestive circumstance which might have afforded matter
of thought to a more experienced observer than Archie,
wrapped in a shawl nearly identical with Kirstie&rsquo;s, but a
thought more gaudy and conspicuously newer. At the
sight, Kirstie grew more tall&mdash;Kirstie showed her classical
profile, nose in air and nostril spread, the pure blood came
in her cheek evenly in a delicate living pink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A braw day to ye, Mistress Elliott,&rdquo; said she, and
hostility and gentility were nicely mingled in her tones.
&ldquo;A fine day, mem,&rdquo; the laird&rsquo;s wife would reply with a
miraculous curtsey, spreading the while her plumage&mdash;setting
off, in other words, and with arts unknown to the
mere man, the pattern of her India shawl. Behind her, the
whole Cauldstaneslap contingent marched in closer order,
and with an indescribable air of being in the presence of
the foe; and while Dandie saluted his aunt with a certain
familiarity as of one who was well in court, Hob marched on
in awful immobility. There appeared upon the face of
this attitude in the family the consequences of some dreadful
feud. Presumably the two women had been principals in
the original encounter, and the laird had probably been
drawn into the quarrel by the ears, too late to be included in
the present skin-deep reconciliation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kirstie,&rdquo; said Archie one day, &ldquo;what is this you have
against your family?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dinna complean,&rdquo; said Kirstie, with a flush. &ldquo;I
say naething.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you do not&mdash;not even good-day to your own
nephew,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hae naething to be ashamed of,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
say the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer with a good grace. If Hob was ill, or
in preeson or poverty, I would see to him blithely. But for
curtchying and complimenting and colloguing, thank ye
kindly!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archie had a bit of a smile: he leaned back in his chair.
&ldquo;I think you and Mrs. Robert are not very good friends,&rdquo;
says he slily, &ldquo;when you have your India shawls on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked upon him in silence, with a sparkling eye but
an indecipherable expression; and that was all that Archie
was ever destined to learn of the battle of the India shawls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do none of them ever come here to see you?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Archie,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I hope that I ken my place
better. It would be a queer thing, I think, if I was to
clamjamfry up your faither&rsquo;s house&mdash;that I should say it!&mdash;wi&rsquo;
a dirty, black-a-vised clan, no ane o&rsquo; them it was worth
while to mar soap upon but just mysel&rsquo;!  Na, they&rsquo;re all
damnifeed wi&rsquo; the black Ellwalds. I have nae patience wi&rsquo;
black folk.&rdquo; Then, with a sudden consciousness of the case
of Archie, &ldquo;No that it maitters for men sae muckle,&rdquo; she
made haste to add, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s naebody can deny that it&rsquo;s
unwomanly. Long hair is the ornament o&rsquo; woman ony
way; we&rsquo;ve good warrandise for that&mdash;it&rsquo;s in the Bible&mdash;and
wha can doubt that the Apostle had some gowden-haired
lassie in his mind&mdash;Apostle and all, for what was he
but just a man like yersel&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>A LEAF FROM CHRISTINA&rsquo;S PSALM-BOOK</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Archie</span> was sedulous at church. Sunday after Sunday he
sat down and stood up with that small company, heard the
voice of Mr. Torrance leaping like an ill-played clarionet
from key to key, and had an opportunity to study his moth-eaten
gown and the black thread mittens that he joined together
in prayer, and lifted up with a reverent solemnity in
the act of benediction. Hermiston pew was a little square
box, dwarfish in proportion with the kirk itself, and enclosing
a table not much bigger than a footstool. There sat Archie,
an apparent prince, the only undeniable gentleman and the
only great heritor in the parish, taking his ease in the only
pew, for no other in the kirk had doors. Thence he might
command an undisturbed view of that congregation of solid
plaided men, strapping wives and daughters, oppressed
children, and uneasy sheep-dogs. It was strange how
Archie missed the look of race; except the dogs, with their
refined foxy faces and inimitably curling tails, there was no
one present with the least claim to gentility. The Cauldstaneslap
party was scarcely an exception; Dandie perhaps,
as he amused himself making verses through the interminable
burden of the service, stood out a little by the glow
in his eye and a certain superior animation of face and alertness
of body; but even Dandie slouched like a rustic. The
rest of the congregation, like so many sheep, oppressed him
with a sense of hob-nailed routine, day following day&mdash;of
physical labour in the open air, oatmeal porridge, peas bannock,
the somnolent fireside in the evening, and the night-long
nasal slumbers in a box-bed. Yet he knew many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
them to be shrewd and humorous, men of character, notable
women, making a bustle in the world and radiating an influence
from their low-browed doors. He knew besides
they were like other men; below the crust of custom, rapture
found a way; he had heard them beat the timbrel before
Bacchus&mdash;had heard them shout and carouse over their
whisky-toddy; and not the most Dutch-bottomed and severe
faces among them all, not even the solemn elders themselves,
but were capable of singular gambols at the voice of love.
Men drawing near to an end of life&rsquo;s adventurous journey&mdash;maids
thrilling with fear and curiosity on the threshold of
entrance&mdash;women who had borne and perhaps buried
children, who could remember the clinging of the small dead
hands and the patter of the little feet now silent&mdash;he marvelled
that among all those faces there should be no face of
expectation, none that was mobile, none into which the
rhythm and poetry of life had entered. &ldquo;O for a live face,&rdquo;
he thought; and at times he had a memory of Lady Flora;
and at times he would study the living gallery before him
with despair, and would see himself go on to waste his days
in that joyless, pastoral place, and death come to him, and
his grave be dug under the rowans, and the Spirit of the
Earth laugh out in a thunder-peal at the huge fiasco.</p>

<p>On this particular Sunday, there was no doubt but that
the spring had come at last. It was warm, with a latent
shiver in the air that made the warmth only the more welcome.
The shallows of the stream glittered and tinkled
among bunches of primrose. Vagrant scents of the earth
arrested Archie by the way with moments of ethereal intoxication.
The grey, Quakerish dale was still only awakened
in places and patches from the sobriety of its winter colouring;
and he wondered at its beauty; an essential beauty of
the old earth it seemed to him, not resident in particulars but
breathing to him from the whole. He surprised himself by a
sudden impulse to write poetry&mdash;he did so sometimes, loose,
galloping octosyllabics in the vein of Scott&mdash;and when he
had taken his place on a boulder, near some fairy falls and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
shaded by a whip of a tree that was already radiant with new
leaves, it still more surprised him that he should find nothing
to write. His heart perhaps beat in time to some vast
indwelling rhythm of the universe. By the time he came
to a corner of the valley and could see the kirk, he had so
lingered by the way that the first psalm was finishing.
The nasal psalmody, full of turns and trills and graceless
graces, seemed the essential voice of the kirk itself upraised
in thanksgiving. &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s alive,&rdquo; he said; and
again cries it aloud, &ldquo;thank God, everything&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo; He
lingered yet a while in the kirkyard. A tuft of primroses
was blooming hard by the leg of an old, black table
tombstone, and he stopped to contemplate the random
apologue. They stood forth on the cold earth with a trenchancy
of contrast; and he was struck with a sense of incompleteness
in the day, the season, and the beauty that
surrounded him&mdash;the chill there was in the warmth, the gross
black clods about the opening primroses, the damp earthy
smell that was everywhere intermingled with the scents.
The voice of the aged Torrance within rose in an ecstasy.
And he wondered if Torrance also felt in his old bones the
joyous influence of the spring morning; Torrance, or the
shadow of what once was Torrance, that must come so soon
to lie outside here in the sun and rain with all his
rheumatisms, while a new minister stood in his room and
thundered from his own familiar pulpit? The pity of it,
and something of the chill of the grave, shook him for a
moment as he made haste to enter.</p>

<p>He went up the aisle reverently, and took his place in
the pew with lowered eyes, for he feared he had already
offended the kind old gentleman in the pulpit, and was
sedulous to offend no further. He could not follow the
prayer, not even the heads of it. Brightnesses of azure,
clouds of fragrance, a tinkle of falling water and singing birds,
rose like exhalations from some deeper, aboriginal memory,
that was not his, but belonged to the flesh on his bones.
His body remembered; and it seemed to him that his body
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
was in no way gross, but ethereal and perishable like a strain
of music; and he felt for it an exquisite tenderness as for a
child, an innocent, full of beautiful instincts and destined to
an early death. And he felt for old Torrance&mdash;of the many
supplications, of the few days&mdash;a pity that was near to
tears. The prayer ended. Right over him was a tablet in
the wall, the only ornament in the roughly masoned chapel&mdash;for
it was no more; the tablet commemorated, I was
about to say the virtues, but rather the existence of a former
Rutherford of Hermiston; and Archie, under that trophy
of his long descent and local greatness, leaned back in the
pew and contemplated vacancy with the shadow of a smile
between playful and sad, that became him strangely.
Dandie&rsquo;s sister, sitting by the side of Clem in her new
Glasgow finery, chose that moment to observe the young
laird. Aware of the stir of his entrance, the little formalist
had kept her eyes fastened and her face prettily composed
during the prayer. It was not hypocrisy, there was no one
further from a hypocrite. The girl had been taught to
behave: to look up, to look down, to look unconscious, to
look seriously impressed in church, and in every conjuncture
to look her best. That was the game of female life, and
she played it frankly. Archie was the one person in church
who was of interest, who was somebody new, reputed eccentric,
known to be young, and a laird, and still unseen by
Christina. Small wonder that, as she stood there in her attitude
of pretty decency, her mind should run upon him! If
he spared a glance in her direction, he should know she was
a well-behaved young lady who had been to Glasgow. In
reason he must admire her clothes, and it was possible that
he should think her pretty. At that her heart beat the
least thing in the world; and she proceeded, by way of a
corrective, to call up and dismiss a series of fancied pictures
of the young man who should now, by rights, be looking at
her. She settled on the plainest of them&mdash;a pink short
young man with a dish face and no figure, at whose admiration
she could afford to smile; but for all that, the consciousness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
of his gaze (which was really fixed on Torrance
and his mittens) kept her in something of a flutter till the
word Amen. Even then, she was far too well-bred to gratify
her curiosity with any impatience. She resumed her seat
languidly&mdash;this was a Glasgow touch&mdash;she composed her
dress, rearranged her nosegay of primroses, looked first in
front, then behind upon the other side, and at last allowed
her eyes to move, without hurry, in the direction of the Hermiston
pew. For a moment they were riveted. Next she
had plucked her gaze home again like a tame bird who
should have meditated flight. Possibilities crowded on her;
she hung over the future and grew dizzy; the image of this
young man, slim, graceful, dark, with the inscrutable half-smile,
attracted and repelled her like a chasm. &ldquo;I
wonder, will I have met my fate?&rdquo; she thought, and her
heart swelled.</p>

<p>Torrance was got some way into his first exposition,
positing a deep layer of texts as he went along, laying the
foundations of his discourse, which was to deal with a nice
point in divinity, before Archie suffered his eyes to wander.
They fell first of all on Clem, looking insupportably prosperous,
and patronising Torrance with the favour of a modified
attention, as of one who was used to better things in Glasgow.
Though he had never before set eyes on him, Archie had no
difficulty in identifying him, and no hesitation in pronouncing
him vulgar, the worst of the family. Clem was leaning
lazily forward when Archie first saw him. Presently he
leaned nonchalantly back; and that deadly instrument, the
maiden, was suddenly unmasked in profile. Though not
quite in the front of the fashion (had anybody cared!),
certain artful Glasgow mantua-makers, and her own inherent
taste, had arrayed her to great advantage. Her
accoutrement was, indeed, a cause of heart-burning, and
almost of scandal, in that infinitesimal kirk company. Mrs.
Hob had said her say at Cauldstaneslap. &ldquo;Daftlike!&rdquo; she
had pronounced it. &ldquo;A jaiket that&rsquo;ll no meet! Whaur&rsquo;s
the sense of a jaiket that&rsquo;ll no button upon you, if it should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
come to be weet? What do ye ca&rsquo; thir things? Demmy
brokens, d&rsquo;ye say? They&rsquo;ll be brokens wi&rsquo; a vengeance or
ye can win back! Weel, I have naething to do wi&rsquo; it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
no good taste.&rdquo; Clem, whose purse had thus metamorphosed
his sister, and who was not insensible to the advertisement,
had come to the rescue with a &ldquo;Hoot, woman!
What do you ken of good taste that has never been to the
ceety?&rdquo; And Hob, looking on the girl with pleased smiles,
as she timidly displayed her finery in the midst of the dark
kitchen, had thus ended the dispute: &ldquo;The cutty looks
weel,&rdquo; he had said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s no very like rain. Wear them
the day, hizzie; but it&rsquo;s no a thing to make a practice o&rsquo;.&rdquo;
In the breasts of her rivals, coming to the kirk very conscious
of white under-linen, and their faces splendid with
much soap, the sight of the toilet had raised a storm of varying
emotion, from the mere unenvious admiration that was
expressed in a long-drawn &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; to the angrier feeling that
found vent in an emphatic &ldquo;Set her up!&rdquo; Her frock was of
straw-coloured jaconet muslin, cut low at the bosom and
short at the ankle, so as to display her <i>demi-broquins</i> of
Regency violet, crossing with many straps upon a yellow
cobweb stocking. According to the pretty fashion in
which our grandmothers did not hesitate to appear, and
our great-aunts went forth armed for the pursuit and
capture of our great-uncles, the dress was drawn up so as to
mould the contour of both breasts, and in the nook between,
a cairngorm brooch maintained it. Here, too, surely in a
very enviable position, trembled the nosegay of primroses.
She wore on her shoulders&mdash;or rather, on her back and not
her shoulders, which it scarcely passed&mdash;a French coat of
sarsenet, tied in front with Margate braces, and of the same
colour with her violet shoes. About her face clustered a
disorder of dark ringlets, a little garland of yellow French
roses surmounted her brow, and the whole was crowned by
a village hat of chipped straw. Amongst all the rosy and
all the weathered faces that surrounded her in church, she
glowed like an open flower&mdash;girl and raiment, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
cairngorm that caught the daylight and returned it in a
fiery flash, and the threads of bronze and gold that played
in her hair.</p>

<p>Archie was attracted by the bright thing like a child.
He looked at her again and yet again, and their looks
crossed. The lip was lifted from her little teeth. He saw
the red blood work vividly under her tawny skin. Her eye,
which was great as a stag&rsquo;s, struck and held his gaze. He
knew who she must be&mdash;Kirstie, she of the harsh diminutive,
his housekeeper&rsquo;s niece, the sister of the rustic prophet,
Gib&mdash;and he found in her the answer to his wishes.</p>

<p>Christina felt the shock of their encountering glances, and
seemed to rise, clothed in smiles, into a region of the vague
and bright. But the gratification was not more exquisite
than it was brief. She looked away abruptly, and immediately
began to blame herself for that abruptness. She
knew what she should have done, too late&mdash;turned slowly
with her nose in the air. And meantime his look was not
removed, but continued to play upon her like a battery of
cannon constantly aimed, and now seemed to isolate her
alone with him, and now seemed to uplift her, as on a
pillory, before the congregation. For Archie continued to
drink her in with his eyes, even as a wayfarer comes to a
well-head on a mountain, and stoops his face, and drinks
with thirst unassuageable. In the cleft of her little breasts
the fiery eye of the topaz and the pale florets of primrose
fascinated him. He saw the breasts heave, and the flowers
shake with the heaving, and marvelled what should so much
discompose the girl. And Christina was conscious of his
gaze&mdash;saw it, perhaps, with the dainty plaything of an ear
that peeped among her ringlets; she was conscious of
changing colour, conscious of her unsteady breath. Like
a creature tracked, run down, surrounded, she sought in a
dozen ways to give herself a countenance. She used her
handkerchief&mdash;it was a really fine one&mdash;then she desisted
in a panic: &ldquo;He would only think I was too warm.&rdquo; She
took to reading in the metrical psalms, and then remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>235</span>
it was sermon-time. Last she put a &ldquo;sugar-bool&rdquo;
in her mouth, and the next moment repented of the step.
It was such a homely-like thing! Mr. Archie would never
be eating sweeties in kirk; and, with a palpable effort,
she swallowed it whole, and her colour flamed high. At
this signal of distress Archie awoke to a sense of his ill-behaviour.
What had he been doing? He had been exquisitely
rude in church to the niece of his housekeeper;
he had stared like a lackey and a libertine at a beautiful
and modest girl. It was possible, it was even likely, he
would be presented to her after service in the kirkyard, and
then how was he to look? And there was no excuse. He
had marked the tokens of her shame, of her increasing
indignation, and he was such a fool that he had not understood
them. Shame bowed him down, and he looked
resolutely at Mr. Torrance: who little supposed, good,
worthy man, as he continued to expound justification by
faith, what was his true business: to play the part of derivative
to a pair of children at the old game of falling in love.</p>

<p>Christina was greatly relieved at first. It seemed to
her that she was clothed again. She looked back on what
had passed. All would have been right if she had not
blushed, a silly fool! There was nothing to blush at, if
she <i>had</i> taken a sugar-bool. Mrs. MacTaggart, the elder&rsquo;s
wife in St. Enoch&rsquo;s, took them often. And if he had looked
at her, what was more natural than that a young gentleman
should look at the best-dressed girl in church? And at the
same time, she knew far otherwise, she knew there was
nothing casual or ordinary in the look, and valued herself
on its memory like a decoration. Well, it was a blessing
he had found something else to look at! And presently
she began to have other thoughts. It was necessary, she
fancied, that she should put herself right by a repetition of
the incident, better managed. If the wish was father to
the thought, she did not know or she would not recognise it.
It was simply as a man&oelig;uvre of propriety, as something
called for to lessen the significance of what had gone before,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
that she should a second time meet his eyes, and this time
without blushing. And at the memory of the blush, she
blushed again, and became one general blush burning from
head to foot. Was ever anything so indelicate, so forward,
done by a girl before? And here she was, making an exhibition
of herself before the congregation about nothing!
She stole a glance upon her neighbours, and behold! they
were steadily indifferent, and Clem had gone to sleep.
And still the one idea was becoming more and more potent
with her, that in common prudence she must look again
before the service ended. Something of the same sort was
going forward in the mind of Archie, as he struggled with
the load of penitence. So it chanced that, in the flutter of
the moment when the last psalm was given out, and Torrance
was reading the verse, and the leaves of every psalm-book
in church were rustling under busy fingers, two
stealthy glances were sent out like antennæ among the pews
and on the indifferent and absorbed occupants, and drew
timidly nearer to the straight line between Archie and
Christina. They met, they lingered together for the least
fraction of time, and that was enough. A charge as of
electricity passed through Christina, and behold! the leaf
of her psalm-book was torn across.</p>

<p>Archie was outside by the gate of the graveyard, conversing
with Hob and the minister and shaking hands all
round with the scattering congregation, when Clem and
Christina were brought up to be presented. The laird took
off his hat and bowed to her with grace and respect. Christina
made her Glasgow curtsey to the laird, and went on
again up the road for Hermiston and Cauldstaneslap, walking
fast, breathing hurriedly with a heightened colour, and
in this strange frame of mind, that when she was alone she
seemed in high happiness, and when any one addressed her
she resented it like a contradiction. A part of the way she
had the company of some neighbour girls and a loutish
young man; never had they seemed so insipid, never had
she made herself so disagreeable. But these struck aside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
to their various destinations or were out-walked and left
behind; and when she had driven off with sharp words the
proffered convoy of some of her nephews and nieces, she
was free to go on alone up Hermiston brae, walking on air,
dwelling intoxicated among clouds of happiness. Near to
the summit she heard steps behind her, a man&rsquo;s steps, light
and very rapid. She knew the foot at once and walked the
faster. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s me he&rsquo;s wanting, he can run for it,&rdquo; she
thought, smiling.</p>

<p>Archie overtook her like a man whose mind was made
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Kirstie,&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Christina, if you please, Mr. Weir,&rdquo; she interrupted.
&ldquo;I canna bear the contraction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You forget it has a friendly sound for me. Your aunt
is an old friend of mine, and a very good one. I hope we
shall see much of you at Hermiston?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My aunt and my sister-in-law doesna agree very well.
Not that I have much ado with it. But still when I&rsquo;m
stopping in the house, if I was to be visiting my aunt, it
would not look considerate-like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you kindly, Mr. Weir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I whiles
think myself it&rsquo;s a great peety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I am sure your voice would always be for peace!&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldna be too sure of that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have
my days like other folk, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, in our old kirk, among our good old grey
dames, you made an effect like sunshine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that would be my Glasgow clothes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not think I was so much under the influence of
pretty frocks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled with a half look at him. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more
than you!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But you see I&rsquo;m only Cinderella.
I&rsquo;ll have to put all these things by in my trunk; next
Sunday I&rsquo;ll be as grey as the rest. They&rsquo;re Glasgow clothes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
you see, and it would never do to make a practice of it. It
would seem terrible conspicuous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By that they were come to the place where their ways
severed. The old grey moors were all about them; in the
midst a few sheep wandered; and they could see on the one
hand the straggling caravan scaling the braes in front of
them for Cauldstaneslap, and on the other, the contingent
from Hermiston bending off and beginning to disappear by
detachments into the policy gate. It was in these circumstances
that they turned to say farewell, and deliberately
exchanged a glance as they shook hands. All passed as it
should, genteelly; and in Christina&rsquo;s mind, as she mounted
the first steep ascent for Cauldstaneslap, a gratifying sense of
triumph prevailed over the recollection of minor lapses and
mistakes. She had kilted her gown, as she did usually at
that rugged pass; but when she spied Archie still standing
and gazing after her, the skirts came down again as if by
enchantment. Here was a piece of nicety for that upland
parish, where the matrons marched with their coats kilted
in the rain, and the lasses walked barefoot to kirk through
the dust of summer, and went bravely down by the burn-side,
and sat on stones to make a public toilet before entering!
It was perhaps an air wafted from Glasgow; or perhaps
it marked a stage of that dizziness of gratified vanity,
in which the instinctive act passed unperceived. He was
looking after! She unloaded her bosom of a prodigious
sigh that was all pleasure, and betook herself to run. When
she had overtaken the stragglers of her family, she caught
up the niece whom she had so recently repulsed, and kissed
and slapped her, and drove her away again, and ran after
her with pretty cries and laughter. Perhaps she thought
the laird might still be looking! But it chanced the little
scene came under the view of eyes less favourable; for she
overtook Mrs. Hob marching with Clem and Dand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re shürely fey, lass!&rdquo; quoth Dandie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think shame to yersel&rsquo;, miss!&rdquo; said the strident Mrs.
Hob. &ldquo;Is this the gait to guide yersel&rsquo; on the way hame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
frae kirk? You&rsquo;re shürely no sponsible the day! And
anyway I would mind my guid claes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoot!&rdquo; said Christina, and went on before them,
head in air, treading the rough track with the tread of a
wild doe.</p>

<p>She was in love with herself, her destiny, the air of the
hills, the benediction of the sun. All the way home, she
continued under the intoxication of these sky-scraping
spirits. At table she could talk freely of young Hermiston;
gave her opinion of him off-hand and with a loud voice, that
he was a handsome young gentleman, real well-mannered
and sensible-like, but it was a pity he looked doleful. Only&mdash;the
moment after&mdash;a memory of his eyes in church embarrassed
her. But for this inconsiderable check, all through
meal-time she had a good appetite, and she kept them
laughing at table, until Gib (who had returned before them
from Crossmichael and his separative worship) reproved
the whole of them for their levity.</p>

<p>Singing &ldquo;in to herself&rdquo; as she went, her mind still in
the turmoil of a glad confusion, she rose and tripped upstairs
to a little loft, lighted by four panes in the gable,
where she slept with one of her nieces. The niece, who
followed her, presuming on &ldquo;Auntie&rsquo;s&rdquo; high spirits, was
flounced out of the apartment with small ceremony, and
retired, smarting and half tearful, to bury her woes in the
byre among the hay. Still humming, Christina divested
herself of her finery, and put her treasures one by one in
her great green trunk. The last of these was the psalm-book;
it was a fine piece, the gift of Mistress Clem, in distinct
old-faced type, on paper that had begun to grow foxy
in the warehouse&mdash;not by service&mdash;and she was used to
wrap it in a handkerchief every Sunday after its period of
service was over, and bury it end-wise at the head of her
trunk. As she now took it in hand the book fell open where
the leaf was torn, and she stood and gazed upon that evidence
of her bygone discomposure. There returned again
the vision of the two brown eyes staring at her, intent and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
bright, out of that dark corner of the kirk. The whole
appearance and attitude, the smile, the suggested gesture
of young Hermiston came before her in a flash at the sight
of the torn page. &ldquo;I was surely fey!&rdquo; she said, echoing
the words of Dandie, and at the suggested doom her high
spirits deserted her. She flung herself prone upon the bed,
and lay there, holding the psalm-book in her hands for
hours, for the more part in a mere stupor of unconsenting
pleasure and unreasoning fear. The fear was superstitious;
there came up again and again in her memory Dandie&rsquo;s ill-omened
words, and a hundred grisly and black tales out of
the immediate neighbourhood read her a commentary on
their force. The pleasure was never realised. You might
say the joints of her body thought and remembered, and
were gladdened, but her essential self, in the immediate
theatre of consciousness, talked feverishly of something
else, like a nervous person at a fire. The image that she
most complacently dwelt on was that of Miss Christina in
her character of the Fair Lass of Cauldstaneslap, carrying
all before her in the straw-coloured frock, the violet mantle,
and the yellow cobweb stockings. Archie&rsquo;s image, on the
other hand, when it presented itself was never welcomed&mdash;far
less welcomed with any ardour, and it was exposed at
times to merciless criticism. In the long vague dialogues
she held in her mind, often with imaginary, often with unrealised
interlocutors, Archie, if he were referred to at all,
came in for savage handling. He was described as &ldquo;looking
like a stirk,&rdquo; &ldquo;staring like a caulf,&rdquo; &ldquo;a face like a
ghaist&rsquo;s.&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you call that manners?&rdquo; she said; or,
&ldquo;I soon put him in his place.&rdquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Miss Christina, if you
please, Mr. Weir!</i>&rsquo; says I, and just flyped up my skirt tails.&rdquo;
With gabble like this she would entertain herself long
whiles together, and then her eye would perhaps fall on the
torn leaf, and the eyes of Archie would appear again from
the darkness of the wall, and the voluble words deserted
her, and she would lie still and stupid, and think upon
nothing with devotion, and be sometimes raised by a quiet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
sigh. Had a doctor of medicine come into that loft, he
would have diagnosed a healthy, well-developed, eminently
vivacious lass lying on her face in a fit of the sulks; not one
who had just contracted, or was just contracting, a mortal
sickness of the mind which should yet carry her towards
death and despair. Had it been a doctor of psychology,
he might have been pardoned for divining in the girl a
passion of childish vanity, self-love <i>in excelsis</i>, and no more.
It is to be understood that I have been painting chaos and
describing the inarticulate. Every lineament that appears
is too precise, almost every word used too strong. Take a
finger-post in the mountains on a day of rolling mists; I
have but copied the names that appear upon the pointers,
the names of definite and famous cities far distant, and now
perhaps basking in sunshine; but Christina remained all
these hours, as it were, at the foot of the post itself, not
moving, and enveloped in mutable and blinding wreaths of
haze.</p>

<p>The day was growing late and the sunbeams long and
level, when she sat suddenly up, and wrapped in its handkerchief
and put by that psalm-book which had already
played a part so decisive in the first chapter of her love-story.
In the absence of the mesmerist&rsquo;s eye, we are told
nowadays that the head of a bright nail may fill his place,
if it be steadfastly regarded. So that torn page had riveted
her attention on what might else have been but little, and
perhaps soon forgotten; while the ominous words of Dandie&mdash;heard,
not heeded, and still remembered&mdash;had lent to her
thoughts, or rather to her mood, a cast of solemnity, and
that idea of Fate&mdash;a pagan Fate, uncontrolled by any
Christian deity, obscure, lawless, and august&mdash;moving
undissuadably in the affairs of Christian men. Thus even
that phenomenon of love at first sight, which is so rare and
seems so simple and violent, like a disruption of life&rsquo;s tissue,
may be decomposed into a sequence of accidents happily
concurring.</p>

<p>She put on a grey frock and a pink kerchief, looked at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span>
herself a moment with approval in the small square of glass
that served her for a toilet mirror, and went softly downstairs
through the sleeping house that resounded with the
sound of afternoon snoring. Just outside the door, Dandie
was sitting with a book in his hand, not reading, only
honouring the Sabbath by a sacred vacancy of mind. She
came near him and stood still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for off up the muirs, Dandie,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>There was something unusually soft in her tones that
made him look up. She was pale, her eyes dark and bright;
no trace remained of the levity of the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, lass? Ye&rsquo;ll have yer ups and downs like me, I&rsquo;m
thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for do ye say that?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, for naething,&rdquo; says Dand. &ldquo;Only I think ye&rsquo;re
mair like me than the lave of them. Ye&rsquo;ve mair of the
poetic temper, tho&rsquo; Guid kens little enough of the poetic
taalent. It&rsquo;s an ill gift at the best. Look at yoursel&rsquo;. At
denner you were all sunshine and flowers and laughter,
and now you&rsquo;re like the star of evening on a lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drank in this hackneyed compliment like wine, and
it glowed in her veins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m saying, Dand&rdquo;&mdash;she came nearer him&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
for the muirs. I must have a braith of air. If Clem
was to be speiring for me, try and quaiet him, will ye no?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What way?&rdquo; said Dandie. &ldquo;I ken but the ae way,
and that&rsquo;s leein&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll say ye had a sair heed, if ye like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I havena,&rdquo; she objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daursay no,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I said I would say ye
had; and if ye like to nay-say me when ye come back, it&rsquo;ll
no mateerially maitter, for my chara&rsquo;ter&rsquo;s clean gane a&rsquo;ready
past reca&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Dand, are ye a leear?&rdquo; she asked, lingering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Folks say sae,&rdquo; replied the bard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha says sae?&rdquo; she pursued.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Them that should ken the best,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;The
lassies, for ane.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Dand, you would never lee to me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave that for your pairt of it, ye girzie,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll lee to me fast eneuch, when ye hae gotten a jo.
I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye and it&rsquo;s true; when you have a jo, Miss Kirstie,
it&rsquo;ll be for guid and ill. I ken: I was made that way mysel&rsquo;,
but the deil was in my luck! Here, gang awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye
to your muirs, and let me be; I&rsquo;m in an hour of inspiraution,
ye upsetting tawpie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she clung to her brother&rsquo;s neighbourhood, she knew
not why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will ye no gie&rsquo;s a kiss, Dand?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I aye likit
ye fine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kissed her and considered her a moment; he found
something strange in her. But he was a libertine through
and through, nourished equal contempt and suspicion of all
womankind, and paid his way among them habitually with
idle compliments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gae wa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; ye!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re a dentie baby, and
be content wi&rsquo; that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was Dandie&rsquo;s way; a kiss and a comfit to Jenny&mdash;a
bawbee and my blessing to Jill&mdash;and good-night to the
whole clan of ye, my dears! When anything approached
the serious, it became a matter for men, he both thought
and said. Women, when they did not absorb, were only
children to be shoo&rsquo;d away. Merely in his character of
connoisseur, however, Dandle glanced carelessly after his
sister as she crossed the meadow. &ldquo;The brat&rsquo;s no that
bad!&rdquo; he thought with surprise, for though he had just been
paying her compliments, he had not really looked at her.
&ldquo;Hey! what&rsquo;s yon?&rdquo; For the grey dress was cut with
short sleeves and skirts, and displayed her trim strong legs
clad in pink stockings of the same shade as the kerchief
she wore round her shoulders, and that shimmered as she
went. This was not her way in undress; he knew her ways
and the ways of the whole sex in the country-side, no one
better; when they did not go barefoot, they wore stout
&ldquo;rig and furrow&rdquo; woollen hose of an invisible blue mostly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
when they were not black outright; and Dandie, at sight
of this daintiness, put two and two together. It was a silk
handkerchief, then they would be silken hose; they matched&mdash;then
the whole outfit was a present of Clem&rsquo;s, a costly
present, and not something to be worn through bog and
briar, or on a late afternoon of Sunday. He whistled.
&ldquo;My denty May, either your heid&rsquo;s fair turned, or there&rsquo;s
some ongoings!&rdquo; he observed, and dismissed the subject.</p>

<p>She went slowly at first, but ever straighter and faster
for the Cauldstaneslap, a pass among the hills to which the
farm owed its name. The Slap opened like a doorway between
two rounded hillocks; and through this ran the short
cut to Hermiston. Immediately on the other side it went
down through the Deil&rsquo;s Hags, a considerable marshy hollow
of the hill tops, full of springs, and crouching junipers, and
pools where the black peat-water slumbered. There was
no view from here. A man might have sat upon the Praying
Weaver&rsquo;s Stone a half-century, and seen none but the
Cauldstaneslap children twice in the twenty-four hours
on their way to the school and back again, an occasional
shepherd, the irruption of a clan of sheep, or the birds who
haunted about the springs, drinking and shrilly piping.
So, when she had once passed the Slap, Kirstie was received
into seclusion. She looked back a last time at the farm.
It still lay deserted except for the figure of Dandie, who
was now seen to be scribbling in his lap, the hour of expected
inspiration having come to him at last. Thence
she passed rapidly through the morass, and came to the
farther end of it, where a sluggish burn discharges, and the
path for Hermiston accompanies it on the beginning of its
downward way. From this corner a wide view was opened
to her of the whole stretch of braes upon the other side,
still sallow and in places rusty with the winter, with the
path marked boldly, here and there by the burn-side a tuft
of birches, and&mdash;two miles off as the crow flies&mdash;from its
enclosures and young plantations, the windows of Hermiston
glittering in the western sun.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span></p>

<p>Here she sat down and waited, and looked for a long
time at these far-away bright panes of glass. It amused
her to have so extended a view, she thought. It amused
her to see the house of Hermiston&mdash;to see &ldquo;folk&rdquo;; and
there was an indistinguishable human unit, perhaps the
gardener, visibly sauntering on the gravel paths.</p>

<p>By the time the sun was down and all the easterly braes
lay plunged in clear shadow, she was aware of another
figure coming up the path at a most unequal rate of approach,
now half running, now pausing and seeming to
hesitate. She watched him at first with a total suspension
of thought. She held her thought as a person holds his breathing.
Then she consented to recognise him. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll no be
coming here, he canna be; it&rsquo;s no possible.&rdquo; And there
began to grow upon her a subdued choking suspense. He
<i>was</i> coming; his hesitations had quite ceased, his step grew
firm and swift; no doubt remained; and the question
loomed up before her instant: what was she to do? It was
all very well to say that her brother was a laird himself; it
was all very well to speak of casual intermarriages and to
count cousinship, like Auntie Kirstie. The difference in
their social station was trenchant; propriety, prudence,
all that she had ever learned, all that she knew, bade her
flee. But on the other hand the cup of life now offered to
her was too enchanting. For one moment, she saw the
question clearly, and definitely made her choice. She
stood up and showed herself an instant in the gap relieved
upon the sky line; and the next, fled trembling and
sat down glowing with excitement on the Weaver&rsquo;s Stone.
She shut her eyes, seeking, praying for composure. Her
hand shook in her lap, and her mind was full of incongruous
and futile speeches. What was there to make a work about?
She could take care of herself, she supposed! There was no
harm in seeing the laird. It was the best thing that could
happen. She would mark a proper distance to him once
and for all. Gradually the wheels of her nature ceased to
go round so madly, and she sat in passive expectation, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
quiet, solitary figure in the midst of the grey moss. I have
said she was no hypocrite, but here I am at fault. She
never admitted to herself that she had come up the hill to
look for Archie. And perhaps after all she did not know,
perhaps came as a stone falls. For the steps of love in the
young, and especially in girls, are instinctive and unconscious.</p>

<p>In the meantime Archie was drawing rapidly near, and
he at least was consciously seeking her neighbourhood.
The afternoon had turned to ashes in his mouth; the memory
of the girl had kept him from reading and drawn him as
with cords; and at last, as the cool of the evening began
to come on, he had taken his hat and set forth, with a
smothered ejaculation, by the moor path to Cauldstaneslap.
He had no hope to find her, he took the off chance without
expectation of result and to relieve his uneasiness. The
greater was his surprise, as he surmounted the slope and
came into the hollow of the Deil&rsquo;s Hags, to see there, like
an answer to his wishes, the little womanly figure in the grey
dress and the pink kerchief sitting little, and low, and lost,
and acutely solitary, in these desolate surroundings and on
the weather-beaten stone of the dead weaver. Those things
that still smacked of winter were all rusty about her, and
those things that already relished of the spring had put
forth the tender and lively colours of the season. Even in
the unchanging face of the death-stone, changes were to be
remarked; and in the channeled lettering, the moss began
to renew itself in jewels of green. By an afterthought that
was a stroke of art, she had turned up over her head the back
of the kerchief; so that it now framed becomingly her
vivacious and yet pensive face. Her feet were gathered
under her on the one side, and she leaned on her bare arm,
which showed out strong and round, tapered to a slim wrist,
and shimmered in the fading light.</p>

<p>Young Hermiston was struck with a certain chill. He
was reminded that he now dealt in serious matters of life
and death. This was a grown woman he was approaching,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
endowed with her mysterious potencies and attractions,
the treasury of the continued race, and he was neither better
nor worse than the average of his sex and age. He had a
certain delicacy which had preserved him hitherto unspotted,
and which (had either of them guessed it) made him a more
dangerous companion when his heart should be really
stirred. His throat was dry as he came near; but the
appealing sweetness of her smile stood between them like
a guardian angel.</p>

<p>For she turned to him and smiled, though without
rising. There was a shade in this cavalier greeting that
neither of them perceived; neither he, who simply thought
it gracious and charming as herself; nor yet she, who did
not observe (quick as she was) the difference between rising
to meet the laird, and remaining seated to receive the expected
admirer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are ye stepping west, Hermiston?&rdquo; said she, giving
him his territorial name after the fashion of the countryside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said he, a little hoarsely, &ldquo;but I think I will
be about the end of my stroll now. Are you like me, Miss
Christina? The house would not hold me. I came here
seeking air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took his seat at the other end of the tombstone and
studied her, wondering what was she. There was infinite
import in the question alike for her and him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I couldna bear the roof either. It&rsquo;s
a habit of mine to come up here about the gloaming when
it&rsquo;s quaiet and caller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a habit of my mother&rsquo;s also,&rdquo; he said gravely.
The recollection half startled him as he expressed it. He
looked around. &ldquo;I have scarce been here since. It&rsquo;s
peaceful,&rdquo; he said, with a long breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no like Glasgow,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;A weary place,
yon Glasgow! But what a day have I had for my hame-coming,
and what a bonny evening!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it was a wonderful day,&rdquo; said Archie. &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span>
think I will remember it years and years until I come to
die. On days like this&mdash;I do not know if you feel as I do&mdash;but
everything appears so brief, and fragile, and exquisite,
that I am afraid to touch life. We are here for so short a
time; and all the old people before us&mdash;Rutherfords of
Hermiston, Elliotts of the Cauldstaneslap&mdash;that were here
but a while since riding about and keeping up a great noise
in this quiet corner&mdash;making love too, and marrying&mdash;why,
where are they now? It&rsquo;s deadly commonplace, but, after
all, the commonplaces are the great poetic truths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was sounding her, semi-consciously, to see if she
could understand him; to learn if she were only an animal
the colour of flowers, or had a soul in her to keep her sweet.
She, on her part, her means well in hand, watched, woman-like,
for any opportunity to shine, to abound in his humour,
whatever that might be. The dramatic artist, that lies
dormant or only half awake in most human beings, had in
her sprung to his feet in a divine fury, and chance had
served her well. She looked upon him with a subdued
twilight look that became the hour of the day and the train
of thought; earnestness shone through her like stars in the
purple west; and from the great but controlled upheaval
of her whole nature there passed into her voice, and ran
in her lightest words, a thrill of emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you mind of Dand&rsquo;s song?&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I
think he&rsquo;ll have been trying to say what you have been
thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I never heard it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Repeat it to me, can
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing wanting the tune,&rdquo; said Kirstie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then sing it me,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the Lord&rsquo;s Day? That would never do, Mr.
Weir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I am not so strict a keeper of the Sabbath,
and there is no one in this place to hear us unless the poor
old ancient under the stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No that I&rsquo;m thinking that really,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
my way of thinking, it&rsquo;s just as serious as a psalm. Will
I sooth it to ye, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said he, and, drawing near to her on
the tombstone, prepared to listen.</p>

<p>She sat up as if to sing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only can sooth it to ye,&rdquo;
she explained. &ldquo;I wouldna like to sing out loud on the
Sabbath. I think the birds would carry news of it to
Gilbert,&rdquo; and she smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the Elliotts,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;and I think there&rsquo;s few bonnier bits in the
book-poets, though Dand has never got printed yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she began, in the low, clear tones of her half voice,
now sinking almost to a whisper, now rising to a particular
note which was her best, and which Archie learned to wait
for with growing emotion:&mdash;</p>

<p>All the time she sang she looked steadfastly before her,
her knees straight, her hands upon her knee, head cast back
and up. The expression was admirable throughout, for
had she not learned it from the lips and under the criticism
of the author? When it was done, she turned upon Archie
a face softly bright, and eyes gently suffused and shining
in the twilight, and his heart rose and went out to her with
boundless pity and sympathy. His question was answered.
She was a human being tuned to a sense of the tragedy of
life; there were pathos and music and a great heart in
the girl.</p>

<p>He arose instinctively, she also; for she saw she had
gained a point, and scored the impression deeper, and she
had wit enough left to flee upon a victory. They were but
commonplaces that remained to be exchanged, but the low,
moved voices in which they passed made them sacred in
the memory. In the falling greyness of the evening he
watched her figure winding through the morass, saw it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
turn a last time and wave a hand, and then pass through
the Slap; and it seemed to him as if something went along
with her out of the deepest of his heart. And something
surely had come, and come to dwell there. He had retained
from childhood a picture, now half obliterated by the
passage of time and the multitude of fresh impressions,
of his mother telling him, with the fluttered earnestness of
her voice, and often with dropping tears, the tale of the
&ldquo;Praying Weaver,&rdquo; on the very scene of his brief tragedy
and long repose. And now there was a companion piece;
and he beheld, and he should behold for ever, Christina
perched on the same tomb, in the grey colours of the evening,
gracious, dainty, perfect as a flower, and she also
singing&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p class="noind">of their common ancestors now dead, of their rude wars
composed, their weapons buried with them, and of these
strange changelings, their descendants, who lingered a little
in their places, and would soon be gone also, and perhaps
sung of by others at the gloaming hour. By one of the unconscious
arts of tenderness the two women were enshrined
together in his memory. Tears, in that hour of sensibility,
came into his eyes indifferently at the thought of either;
and the girl, from being something merely bright and
shapely, was caught up into the zone of things serious as
life and death and his dead mother. So that in all ways
and on either side, Fate played his game artfully with this
poor pair of children. The generations were prepared,
the pangs were made ready, before the curtain rose on the
dark drama.</p>

<p>In the same moment of time that she disappeared from
Archie, there opened before Kirstie&rsquo;s eyes the cup-like
hollow in which the farm lay. She saw, some five hundred
feet below her, the house making itself bright with candles,
and this was a broad hint to her to hurry. For they were
only kindled on a Sabbath night with a view to that family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
worship which rounded in the incomparable tedium of the
day and brought on the relaxation of supper. Already
she knew that Robert must be withinsides at the head of
the table, &ldquo;waling the portions&rdquo;; for it was Robert in his
quality of family priest and judge, not the gifted Gilbert,
who officiated. She made good time accordingly down
the steep ascent, and came up to the door panting as the
three younger brothers, all roused at last from slumber,
stood together in the cool and the dark of the evening
with a fry of nephews and nieces about them, chatting and
awaiting the expected signal. She stood back; she had
no mind to direct attention to her late arrival or to her
labouring breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kirstie, ye have shaved it this time, my lass,&rdquo; said
Clem. &ldquo;Whaur were ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, just taking a dander by mysel&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Kirstie.</p>

<p>And the talk continued on the subject of the American
War, without further reference to the truant who stood
by them in the covert of the dusk, thrilling with happiness
and the sense of guilt.</p>

<p>The signal was given, and the brothers began to go in
one after another, amid the jostle and throng of Hob&rsquo;s
children.</p>

<p>Only Dandie, waiting till the last, caught Kirstie by
the arm. &ldquo;When did ye begin to dander in pink hosen,
Mistress Elliott?&rdquo; he whispered slily.</p>

<p>She looked down; she was one blush. &ldquo;I maun have
forgotten to change them,&rdquo; said she; and went in to prayers
in her turn with a troubled mind, between anxiety as to
whether Dand should have observed her yellow stockings
at church, and should thus detect her in a palpable falsehood,
and shame that she had already made good his prophecy.
She remembered the words of it, how it was to be
when she had gotten a jo, and that that would be for good
and evil. &ldquo;Will I have gotten my jo now?&rdquo; she thought
with a secret rapture.</p>

<p>And all through prayers, where it was her principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
business to conceal the pink stockings from the eyes of the
indifferent Mrs. Hob&mdash;and all through supper, as she made
a feint of eating and sat at the table radiant and constrained&mdash;and
again when she had left them and come into her
chamber, and was alone with her sleeping niece, and could
at last lay aside the armour of society&mdash;the same words
sounded within her, the same profound note of happiness,
of a world all changed and renewed, of a day that had been
passed in Paradise, and of a night that was to be heaven
opened. All night she seemed to be conveyed smoothly
upon a shallow stream of sleep and waking, and through the
bowers of Beulah; all night she cherished to her heart that
exquisite hope; and if, towards morning, she forgot it a
while in a more profound unconsciousness, it was to catch
again the rainbow thought with her first moment of awaking.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>ENTER MEPHISTOPHELES</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Two</span> days later a gig from Crossmichael deposited Frank
Innes at the doors of Hermiston. Once in a way, during
the past winter, Archie, in some acute phase of boredom,
had written him a letter. It had contained something in
the nature of an invitation, or a reference to an invitation&mdash;precisely
what, neither of them now remembered. When
Innes had received it, there had been nothing further from
his mind than to bury himself in the moors with Archie;
but not even the most acute political heads are guided
through the steps of life with unerring directness. That
would require a gift of prophecy which has been denied to
man. For instance, who could have imagined that, not
a month after he had received the letter, and turned it into
mockery, and put off answering it, and in the end lost it,
misfortunes of a gloomy cast should begin to thicken over
Frank&rsquo;s career? His case may be briefly stated. His father,
a small Morayshire laird with a large family, became recalcitrant
and cut off the supplies; he had fitted himself
out with the beginnings of quite a good law library, which,
upon some sudden losses on the turf, he had been obliged
to sell before they were paid for; and his bookseller, hearing
some rumour of the event, took out a warrant for his arrest.
Innes had early word of it, and was able to take precautions.
In this immediate welter of his affairs, with an unpleasant
charge hanging over him, he had judged it the part of prudence
to be off instantly, had written a fervid letter to his
father at Inverauld, and put himself in the coach for Crossmichael.
Any port in a storm! He was manfully turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>254</span>
his back on the Parliament House and its gay babble, on
porter and oysters, the racecourse and the ring; and manfully
prepared, until these clouds should have blown by,
to share a living grave with Archie Weir at Hermiston.</p>

<p>To do him justice, he was no less surprised to be going
than Archie was to see him come; and he carried off his
wonder with an infinitely better grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here I am!&rdquo; said he, as he alighted. &ldquo;Pylades
has come to Orestes at last. By the way, did you get my
answer? No? How very provoking! Well, here I am
to answer for myself, and that&rsquo;s better still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to see you, of course,&rdquo; said Archie.
&ldquo;I make you heartily welcome, of course. But you surely
have not come to stay, with the Courts still sitting; is that
not most unwise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn the Courts!&rdquo; says Frank. &ldquo;What are the
Courts to friendship and a little fishing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so it was agreed that he was to stay, with no term
to the visit but the term which he had privily set to it himself&mdash;the
day, namely, when his father should have come
down with the dust, and he should be able to pacify the
bookseller. On such vague conditions there began for these
two young men (who were not even friends) a life of great
familiarity and, as the days drew on, less and less intimacy.
They were together at meal-times, together o&rsquo; nights when
the hour had come for whisky-toddy; but it might have
been noticed (had there been any one to pay heed) that they
were rarely so much together by day. Archie had Hermiston
to attend to, multifarious activities in the hills, in
which he did not require, and had even refused, Frank&rsquo;s
escort. He would be off sometimes in the morning and
leave only a note on the breakfast-table to announce the
fact; and sometimes with no notice at all, he would not
return for dinner until the hour was long past. Innes
groaned under these desertions; it required all his philosophy
to sit down to a solitary breakfast with composure
and all his unaffected good-nature to be able to greet Archie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
with friendliness on the more rare occasions when he came
home late for dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what on earth he finds to do, Mrs. Elliott?&rdquo;
said he one morning, after he had just read the hasty billet
and sat down to table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it will be business, sir,&rdquo; replied the housekeeper
drily, measuring his distance off to him by an indicated
curtsey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t imagine what business!&rdquo; he reiterated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it will be <i>his</i> business,&rdquo; retorted the austere
Kirstie.</p>

<p>He turned to her with that happy brightness that made
the charm of his disposition, and broke into a peal of healthy
and natural laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well played, Mrs. Elliott!&rdquo; he cried; and the housekeeper&rsquo;s
face relaxed into the shadow of an iron smile.
&ldquo;Well played indeed!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But you must not be
making a stranger of me like that. Why, Archie and I were
at the High School together, and we&rsquo;ve been to College together,
and we were going to the Bar together, when&mdash;you
know! Dear, dear me! what a pity that was! A life
spoiled, a fine young fellow as good as buried here in the
wilderness with rustics; and all for what? A frolic, silly,
if you like, but no more. God, how good your scones are,
Mrs. Elliott!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re no mines, it was the lassie made them,&rdquo; said
Kirstie; &ldquo;and, saving your presence, there&rsquo;s little sense
in taking the Lord&rsquo;s name in vain about idle vivers that you
fill your kyte wi&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay you&rsquo;re perfectly right, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; quoth the
imperturbable Frank. &ldquo;But as I was saying, this is a pitiable
business, this about poor Archie; and you and I might
do worse than put our heads together, like a couple of
sensible people, and bring it to an end. Let me tell you,
ma&rsquo;am, that Archie is really quite a promising young man,
and in my opinion he would do well at the Bar. As for his
father, no one can deny his ability, and I don&rsquo;t fancy any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
one would care to deny that he has the deil&rsquo;s own
temper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Mr. Innes, I think the lass is crying
on me,&rdquo; said Kirstie, and flounced from the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The damned, cross-grained, old broom-stick!&rdquo; ejaculated
Innes.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Kirstie had escaped into the kitchen,
and before her vassal gave vent to her feelings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, ettercap! Ye&rsquo;ll have to wait on yon Innes!
I canna hand myself in. &lsquo;Puir Erchie!&rsquo; I&rsquo;d &lsquo;puir
Erchie&rsquo; him, if I had my way! And Hermiston with the
deil&rsquo;s ain temper! God, let him take Hermiston&rsquo;s scones
out of his mouth first. There&rsquo;s no a hair on ayther o&rsquo; the
Weirs that hasna mair spunk and dirdum to it than what
he has in his hale dwaibly body! Settin&rsquo; up his snash to
me! Let him gang to the black toon where he&rsquo;s mebbe
wantit&mdash;birling on a curricle&mdash;wi&rsquo; pimatum on his heid&mdash;making
a mess o&rsquo; himsel&rsquo; wi&rsquo; nesty hizzies&mdash;a fair disgrace!&rdquo;
It was impossible to hear without admiration Kirstie&rsquo;s
graduated disgust, as she brought forth, one after another,
these somewhat baseless charges. Then she remembered
her immediate purpose, and turned again on her fascinated
auditor. &ldquo;Do ye no hear me, tawpie? Do ye no hear
what I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; ye? Will I have to shoo ye into him? If
I come to attend to ye, mistress!&rdquo; And the maid fled
the kitchen, which had become practically dangerous, to
attend on Innes&rsquo;s wants in the front parlour.</p>

<p><i>Tantaene irae</i>? Has the reader perceived the reason?
Since Frank&rsquo;s coming there were no more hours of gossip
over the supper-tray! All his blandishments were in vain;
he had started handicapped on the race for Mrs. Elliott&rsquo;s
favour.</p>

<p>But it was a strange thing how misfortune dogged
him in his efforts to be genial. I must guard the reader
against accepting Kirstie&rsquo;s epithets as evidence; she was
more concerned for their vigour than for their accuracy.
Dwaibly, for instance; nothing could be more calumnious.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
Frank was the very picture of good looks, good humour,
and manly youth. He had bright eyes with a sparkle and
a dance to them, curly hair, a charming smile, brilliant
teeth, an admirable carriage of the head, the look of a gentleman,
the address of one accustomed to please at first sight
and to improve the impression. And with all these advantages,
he failed with every one about Hermiston; with the
silent shepherd, with the obsequious grieve, with the groom
who was also the ploughman, with the gardener and the
gardener&rsquo;s sister&mdash;a pious, down-hearted woman with a
shawl over her ears&mdash;he failed equally and flatly. They
did not like him, and they showed it. The little maid,
indeed, was an exception; she admired him devoutly, probably
dreamed of him in her private hours; but she was
accustomed to play the part of silent auditor to Kirstie&rsquo;s
tirades and silent recipient of Kirstie&rsquo;s buffets, and she had
learned not only to be a very capable girl of her years, but
a very secret and prudent one besides. Frank was thus
conscious that he had one ally and sympathiser in the midst
of that general union of disfavour that surrounded, watched,
and waited on him in the house of Hermiston; but he had
little comfort or society from that alliance, and the demure
little maid (twelve on her last birthday) preserved her own
counsel, and tripped on his service, brisk, dumbly responsive,
but inexorably unconversational. For the others, they
were beyond hope and beyond endurance. Never had a
young Apollo been cast among such rustic barbarians. But
perhaps the cause of his ill-success lay in one trait which
was habitual and unconscious with him, yet diagnostic
of the man. It was his practice to approach any one
person at the expense of some one else. He offered you
an alliance against the some one else; he flattered you by
slighting him; you were drawn into a small intrigue against
him before you knew how. Wonderful are the virtues of
this process generally; but Frank&rsquo;s mistake was in the choice
of the some one else. He was not politic in that; he listened
to the voice of irritation. Archie had offended him at first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
by what he had felt to be rather a dry reception, had
offended him since by his frequent absences. He was
besides the one figure continually present in Frank&rsquo;s eye;
and it was to his immediate dependants that Frank could
offer the snare of his sympathy. Now the truth is that the
Weirs, father and son, were surrounded by a posse of strenuous
loyalists. Of my lord they were vastly proud. It was
a distinction in itself to be one of the vassals of the &ldquo;Hanging
Judge,&rdquo; and his gross, formidable joviality was far from
unpopular in the neighbourhood of his home. For Archie
they had, one and all, a sensitive affection and respect
which recoiled from a word of belittlement.</p>

<p>Nor was Frank more successful when he went farther
afield. To the Four Black Brothers, for instance, he was
antipathetic in the highest degree. Hob thought him too
light, Gib too profane. Clem, who saw him but for a day
or two before he went to Glasgow, wanted to know what
the fule&rsquo;s business was, and whether he meant to stay here
all session time! &ldquo;Yon&rsquo;s a drone,&rdquo; he pronounced. As
for Dand, it will be enough to describe their first meeting,
when Frank had been whipping a river and the rustic celebrity
chanced to come along the path.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told you&rsquo;re quite a poet,&rdquo; Frank had said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha tell&rsquo;t ye that, mannie?&rdquo; had been the unconciliating
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, everybody!&rdquo; says Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God! Here&rsquo;s fame!&rdquo; said the sardonic poet, and
he had passed on his way.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, we have here perhaps a truer explanation
of Frank&rsquo;s failures. Had he met Mr. Sheriff
Scott, he could have turned a neater compliment, because
Mr. Scott would have been a friend worth making. Dand,
on the other hand, he did not value sixpence, and he showed
it even while he tried to flatter. Condescension is an excellent
thing, but it is strange how one-sided the pleasure of it is!
He who goes fishing among the Scots peasantry with condescension
for a bait will have an empty basket by evening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span></p>

<p>In proof of this theory Frank made a great success of it
at the Crossmichael Club, to which Archie took him immediately
on his arrival; his own last appearance on that
scene of gaiety. Frank was made welcome there at once,
continued to go regularly, and had attended a meeting (as
the members ever after loved to tell) on the evening before
his death. Young Hay and young Pringle appeared again.
There was another supper at Windielaws, another dinner
at Driffel; and it resulted in Frank being taken to the bosom
of the county people as unreservedly as he had been repudiated
by the country folk. He occupied Hermiston after
the manner of an invader in a conquered capital. He was
perpetually issuing from it, as from a base, to toddy parties,
fishing parties, and dinner parties, to which Archie was not
invited, or to which Archie would not go. It was now that
the name of The Recluse became general for the young man.
Some say that Innes invented it; Innes, at least, spread it
abroad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s all with your Recluse to-day?&rdquo; people would
ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, reclusing away!&rdquo; Innes would declare, with his
bright air of saying something witty; and immediately
interrupt the general laughter which he had provoked much
more by his air than his words, &ldquo;Mind you, it&rsquo;s all very
well laughing, but I&rsquo;m not very well pleased. Poor Archie
is a good fellow, an excellent fellow, a fellow I always liked.
I think it small of him to take his little disgrace so hard and
shut himself up. &lsquo;Grant that it is a ridiculous story, painfully
ridiculous,&rsquo; I keep telling him. &lsquo;Be a man! Live it
down, man!&rsquo; But not he. Of course it&rsquo;s just solitude, and
shame, and all that. But I confess I&rsquo;m beginning to fear
the result. It would be all the pities in the world if a really
promising fellow like Weir was to end ill. I&rsquo;m seriously
tempted to write to Lord Hermiston, and put it plainly to
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would if I were you,&rdquo; some of his auditors would
say, shaking the head, sitting bewildered and confused at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
this new view of the matter, so deftly indicated by a single
word. &ldquo;A capital idea!&rdquo; they would add, and wonder at
the <i>aplomb</i> and position of this young man, who talked as
a matter of course of writing to Hermiston and correcting
him upon his private affairs.</p>

<p>And Frank would proceed, sweetly confidential: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
give you an idea, now. He&rsquo;s actually sore about the way
that I&rsquo;m received and he&rsquo;s left out in the county&mdash;actually
jealous and sore. I&rsquo;ve rallied him and I&rsquo;ve reasoned with
him, told him that every one was most kindly inclined
towards him, told him even that <i>I</i> was received merely
because I was his guest. But it&rsquo;s no use. He will neither
accept the invitations he gets, nor stop brooding about the
ones where he&rsquo;s left out. What I&rsquo;m afraid of is that the
wound&rsquo;s ulcerating. He had always one of those dark,
secret, angry natures&mdash;a little underhand and plenty of
bile&mdash;you know the sort. He must have inherited it from
the Weirs, whom I suspect to have been a worthy family of
weavers somewhere; what&rsquo;s the cant phrase?&mdash;sedentary
occupation. It&rsquo;s precisely the kind of character to go wrong
in a false position like what his father&rsquo;s made for him, or
he&rsquo;s making for himself, whichever you like to call it. And
for my part, I think it a disgrace,&rdquo; Frank would say
generously.</p>

<p>Presently the sorrow and anxiety of this disinterested
friend took shape. He began in private, in conversations
of two, to talk vaguely of bad habits and low habits. &ldquo;I
must say I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s going wrong altogether,&rdquo; he would
say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you plainly, and between ourselves, I
scarcely like to stay there any longer; only, man, I&rsquo;m positively
afraid to leave him alone. You&rsquo;ll see, I shall be
blamed for it later on. I&rsquo;m staying at a great sacrifice.
I&rsquo;m hindering my chances at the Bar, and I can&rsquo;t blind
my eyes to it. And what I&rsquo;m afraid of is, that I&rsquo;m going
to get kicked for it all round before all&rsquo;s done. You see,
nobody believes in friendship nowadays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Innes,&rdquo; his interlocutor would reply, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
good of you, I must say that. If there&rsquo;s any blame going,
you&rsquo;ll always be sure of <i>my</i> good word, for one thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Frank would continue, &ldquo;candidly, I don&rsquo;t
say it&rsquo;s pleasant. He has a very rough way with him; his
father&rsquo;s son, you know. I don&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s rude&mdash;of course,
I couldn&rsquo;t be expected to stand that&mdash;but he steers very
near the wind. No, it&rsquo;s not pleasant; but I tell ye, man,
in conscience I don&rsquo;t think it would be fair to leave him.
Mind you, I don&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s anything actually wrong.
What I say is that I don&rsquo;t like the looks of it, man!&rdquo; and
he would press the arm of his momentary confidant.</p>

<p>In the early stages I am persuaded there was no malice.
He talked but for the pleasure of airing himself. He was
essentially glib, as becomes the young advocate, and essentially
careless of the truth, which is the mark of the young
ass; and so he talked at random. There was no particular
bias, but that one which is indigenous and universal, to
flatter himself and to please and interest the present friend.
And by thus milling air out of his mouth, he had presently
built up a presentation of Archie which was known and
talked of in all corners of the county. Wherever there was a
residential house and a walled garden, wherever there was
a dwarfish castle and a park, wherever a quadruple cottage
by the ruins of a peel-tower showed an old family going
down, and wherever a handsome villa with a carriage
approach and a shrubbery marked the coming up of a new
one&mdash;probably on the wheels of machinery&mdash;Archie began
to be regarded in the light of a dark, perhaps a vicious
mystery, and the future developments of his career to be
looked for with uneasiness and confidential whispering.
He had done something disgraceful, my dear. What, was
not precisely known, and that good kind young man, Mr.
Innes, did his best to make light of it. But there it was.
And Mr. Innes was very anxious about him now; he was
really uneasy, my dear; he was positively wrecking his own
prospects because he dared not leave him alone. How
wholly we all lie at the mercy of a single prater, not needfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
with any malign purpose! And if a man but talks of
himself in the right spirit, refers to his virtuous actions by
the way, and never applies to them the name of virtue, how
easily his evidence is accepted in the court of public opinion!</p>

<p>All this while, however, there was a more poisonous
ferment at work between the two lads, which came late
indeed to the surface, but had modified and magnified their
dissensions from the first. To an idle, shallow, easy-going
customer like Frank, the smell of a mystery was attractive.
It gave his mind something to play with, like a new toy to a
child; and it took him on the weak side, for like many young
men coming to the Bar, and before they have been tried and
found wanting, he flattered himself he was a fellow of unusual
quickness and penetration. They knew nothing of
Sherlock Holmes in those days, but there was a good deal
said of Talleyrand. And if you could have caught Frank
off his guard, he would have confessed with a smirk that, if
he resembled any one, it was the Marquis de Talleyrand-Périgord.
It was on the occasion of Archie&rsquo;s first absence
that this interest took root. It was vastly deepened when
Kirstie resented his curiosity at breakfast, and that same
afternoon there occurred another scene which clinched the
business. He was fishing Swingleburn, Archie accompanying
him, when the latter looked at his watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have something to do.
See you at dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry,&rdquo; cries Frank. &ldquo;Hold on
till I get my rod up. I&rsquo;ll go with you; I&rsquo;m sick of flogging
this ditch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he began to reel up his line.</p>

<p>Archie stood speechless. He took a long while to recover
his wits under this direct attack; but by the time he
was ready with his answer, and the angle was almost packed
up, he had become completely Weir, and the hanging face
gloomed on his young shoulders. He spoke with a laboured
composure, a laboured kindness even; but a child could see
that his mind was made up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Innes; I don&rsquo;t want to be disagreeable,
but let us understand one another from the beginning.
When I want your company, I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; cries Frank, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want my company,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently not just now,&rdquo; replied Archie. &ldquo;I even
indicated to you when I did, if you&rsquo;ll remember&mdash;and that
was at dinner. If we two fellows are to live together
pleasantly&mdash;and I see no reason why we should not&mdash;it can
only be by respecting each other&rsquo;s privacy. If we begin
intruding&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, come! I&rsquo;ll take this at no man&rsquo;s hands. Is this
the way you treat a guest and an old friend?&rdquo; cried Innes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just go home and think over what I said by yourself,&rdquo;
continued Archie, &ldquo;whether it&rsquo;s reasonable, or whether it&rsquo;s
really offensive or not; and let&rsquo;s meet at dinner as though
nothing had happened. I&rsquo;ll put it this way, if you like&mdash;that
I know my own character, that I&rsquo;m looking forward
(with great pleasure, I assure you) to a long visit from you,
and that I&rsquo;m taking precautions at the first. I see the thing
that we&mdash;that I, if you like&mdash;might fall out upon, and I step
in and <i>obsto principiis</i>. I wager you five pounds you&rsquo;ll end
by seeing that I mean friendliness, and I assure you,
Francie, I do,&rdquo; he added, relenting.</p>

<p>Bursting with anger, but incapable of speech, Innes
shouldered his rod, made a gesture of farewell, and strode
off down the burn-side. Archie watched him go without
moving. He was sorry, but quite unashamed. He hated
to be inhospitable, but in one thing he was his father&rsquo;s son.
He had a strong sense that his house was his own and no
man else&rsquo;s; and to, lie at a guest&rsquo;s mercy was what he refused.
He hated to seem harsh. But that was Frank&rsquo;s
look-out. If Frank had been commonly discreet, he would
have been decently courteous. And there was another
consideration. The secret he was protecting was not his
own merely; it was hers: it belonged to that inexpressible
she who was fast taking possession of his soul, and whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
he would soon have defended at the cost of burning cities.
By the time he had watched Frank as far as the Swingleburnfoot,
appearing and disappearing in the tarnished
heather, still stalking at a fierce gait, but already dwindled
in the distance into less than the smallness of Lilliput, he
could afford to smile at the occurrence. Either Frank would
go, and that would be a relief&mdash;or he would continue to
stay, and his host must continue to endure him. And
Archie was now free&mdash;by devious paths, behind hillocks
and in the hollow of burns&mdash;to make for the trysting-place
where Kirstie, cried about by the curlew and the plover,
waited and burned for his coming by the Covenanter&rsquo;s
Stone.</p>

<p>Innes went off down-hill in a passion of resentment,
easy to be understood, but which yielded progressively
to the needs of his situation. He cursed Archie for a cold-hearted,
unfriendly, rude, rude dog; and himself still more
passionately for a fool in having come to Hermiston when
he might have sought refuge in almost any other house in
Scotland. But the step, once taken, was practically irretrievable.
He had no more ready money to go anywhere
else; he would have to borrow from Archie the next club-night;
and ill as he thought of his host&rsquo;s manners, he was
sure of his practical generosity. Frank&rsquo;s resemblance to
Talleyrand strikes me as imaginary; but at least not
Talleyrand himself could have more obediently taken his
lesson from the facts. He met Archie at dinner without
resentment, almost with cordiality. You must take your
friends as you find them, he would have said. Archie
couldn&rsquo;t help being his father&rsquo;s son, or his grandfather&rsquo;s,
the hypothetical weaver&rsquo;s, grandson. The son of a hunks,
he was still a hunks at heart, incapable of true generosity
and consideration: but he had other qualities with which
Frank could divert himself in the meanwhile, and to enjoy
which it was necessary that Frank should keep his temper.</p>

<p>So excellently was it controlled that he awoke next
morning with his head full of a different, though a cognate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
subject. What was Archie&rsquo;s little game? Why did he
shun Frank&rsquo;s company? What was he keeping secret?
Was he keeping tryst with somebody, and was it a woman?
It would be a good joke and a fair revenge to discover.
To that task he set himself with a great deal of patience,
which might have surprised his friends, for he had been
always credited not with patience so much as brilliancy;
and little by little, from one point to another, he at last
succeeded in piecing out the situation. First he remarked
that, although Archie set out in all the directions of the
compass, he always came home again from some point between
the south and west. From the study of a map, and
in consideration of the great expanse of untenanted moorland
running in that direction towards the sources of the
Clyde, he laid his finger on Cauldstaneslap and two other
neighbouring farms, Kingsmuirs and Polintarf. But it was
difficult to advance farther. With his rod for a pretext,
he vainly visited each of them in turn; nothing was to be
seen suspicious about this trinity of moorland settlements.
He would have tried to follow Archie, had it been the least
possible, but the nature of the land precluded the idea. He
did the next best, ensconced himself in a quiet corner, and
pursued his movements with a telescope. It was equally
in vain, and he soon wearied of his futile vigilance, left the
telescope at home, and had almost given the matter up in
despair, when, on the twenty-seventh day of his visit, he
was suddenly confronted with the person whom he sought.
The first Sunday Kirstie had managed to stay away from
kirk on some pretext of indisposition, which was more truly
modesty; the pleasure of beholding Archie seeming too
sacred, too vivid for that public place. On the two following,
Frank had himself been absent on some of his excursions
among the neighbouring families. It was not until the
fourth, accordingly, that Frank had occasion to set eyes on
the enchantress. With the first look, all hesitation was
over. She came with the Cauldstaneslap party; then she
lived at Cauldstaneslap. Here was Archie&rsquo;s secret, here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>266</span>
was the woman, and more than that&mdash;though I have need
here of every manageable attenuation of language&mdash;with
the first look, he had already entered himself as rival. It
was a good deal in pique, it was a little in revenge, it was
much in genuine admiration: the devil may decide the
proportions! I cannot, and it is very likely that Frank
could not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mighty attractive milkmaid,&rdquo; he observed, on the
way home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, the girl you&rsquo;re looking at&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you? Forward
there on the road. She came attended by the rustic bard;
presumably, therefore, belongs to his exalted family. The
single objection! for the Four Black Brothers are awkward
customers. If anything were to go wrong, Gib would
gibber, and Clem would prove inclement; and Dand fly in
danders, and Hob blow up in gobbets. It would be a
Helliott of a business!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very humorous, I am sure,&rdquo; said Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am trying to be so,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s none
too easy in this place, and with your solemn society, my
dear fellow. But confess that the milkmaid has found
favour in your eyes, or resign all claim to be a man of taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no matter,&rdquo; returned Archie.</p>

<p>But the other continued to look at him, steadily and
quizzically, and his colour slowly rose and deepened under
the glance, until not impudence itself could have denied
that he was blushing. And at this Archie lost some of his
control. He changed his stick from one hand to the other,
and&mdash;&ldquo;O, for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t be an ass!&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ass? That&rsquo;s the retort delicate without doubt,&rdquo; says
Frank. &ldquo;Beware of the home-spun brothers, dear. If
they come into the dance, you&rsquo;ll see who&rsquo;s an ass. Think
now, if they only applied (say) a quarter as much talent as
I have applied to the question of what Mr. Archie does
with his evening hours, and why he is so unaffectedly nasty
when the subject&rsquo;s touched on&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are touching on it now,&rdquo; interrupted Archie, with
a wince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you. That was all I wanted, an articulate
confession,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg to remind you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Archie.</p>

<p>But he was interrupted in turn. &ldquo;My dear fellow,
don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s quite needless. The subject&rsquo;s dead and buried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Frank began to talk hastily on other matters, an
art in which he was an adept, for it was his gift to be fluent
on anything or nothing. But although Archie had the grace
or the timidity to suffer him to rattle on, he was by no
means done with the subject. When he came home to
dinner he was greeted with a sly demand, how things were
looking &ldquo;Cauldstaneslap ways.&rdquo; Frank took his first
glass of port out after dinner to the toast of Kirstie, and
later in the evening he returned to the charge again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, Weir, you&rsquo;ll excuse me for returning again to
this affair. I&rsquo;ve been thinking it over, and I wish to beg
you very seriously to be more careful. It&rsquo;s not a safe
business. Not safe, my boy,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s your own fault if I must put a name on the
thing; but really, as a friend, I cannot stand by and see
you rushing head down into these dangers. My dear boy,&rdquo;
said he, holding up a warning cigar, &ldquo;consider! What is
to be the end of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The end of what?&rdquo;&mdash;Archie, helpless with irritation,
persisted in this dangerous and ungracious guard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the end of the milkmaid; or, to speak more by
the card, the end of Miss Christina Elliott of the Cauldstaneslap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; Archie broke out, &ldquo;this is all a figment
of your imagination. There is nothing to be said
against that young lady; you have no right to introduce
her name into the conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a note of it,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;She shall
henceforth be nameless, nameless, nameless, Gregarach! I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
make a note besides of your valuable testimony to her
character. I only want to look at this thing as a man of
the world. Admitted she&rsquo;s an angel&mdash;but, my good fellow,
is she a lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was torture to Archie. &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he
said, struggling to be composed, &ldquo;but because you have
wormed yourself into my confidence&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, come!&rdquo; cried Frank. &ldquo;Your confidence? It
was rosy but unconsenting. Your confidence, indeed?
Now, look! This is what I must say, Weir, for it concerns
your safety and good character, and therefore my
honour as your friend. You say I wormed myself into
your confidence. Wormed is good. But what have I
done? I have put two and two together, just as the
parish will be doing to-morrow, and the whole of Tweeddale
in two weeks, and the Black Brothers&mdash;well, I won&rsquo;t
put a date on that; it will be a dark and stormy morning!
Your secret, in other words, is poor Poll&rsquo;s. And I want
to ask of you as a friend whether you like the prospect?
There are two horns to your dilemma, and I must say for
myself I should look mighty ruefully on either. Do you see
yourself explaining to the Four Black Brothers? or do you
see yourself presenting the milkmaid to papa as the future
lady of Hermiston? Do you? I tell you plainly, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archie rose. &ldquo;I will hear no more of this,&rdquo; he said, in
a trembling voice.</p>

<p>But Frank again held up his cigar. &ldquo;Tell me one
thing first. Tell me if this is not a friend&rsquo;s part that I am
playing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you think it so,&rdquo; replied Archie. &ldquo;I can
go as far as that. I can do so much justice to your motives.
But I will hear no more of it. I am going to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Weir,&rdquo; said Frank heartily. &ldquo;Go to
bed and think over it; and I say, man, don&rsquo;t forget your
prayers! I don&rsquo;t often do the moral&mdash;don&rsquo;t go in for that
sort of thing&mdash;but when I do, there&rsquo;s one thing sure, that I
mean it.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span></p>

<p>So Archie marched off to bed, and Frank sat alone by
the table for another hour or so, smiling to himself richly.
There was nothing vindictive in his nature; but, if revenge
came in his way, it might as well be good, and the thought
of Archie&rsquo;s pillow reflections that night was indescribably
sweet to him. He felt a pleasant sense of power. He
looked down on Archie as on a very little boy whose strings
he pulled&mdash;as on a horse whom he had backed and bridled
by sheer power of intelligence, and whom he might ride to
glory or the grave at pleasure. Which was it to be? He
lingered long, relishing the details of schemes that he was
too idle to pursue. Poor cork upon a torrent, he tasted
that night the sweets of omnipotence, and brooded like a
deity over the strands of that intrigue which was to shatter
him before the summer waned.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h5>A NOCTURNAL VISIT</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Kirstie</span> had many causes of distress. More and more as
we grow old&mdash;and yet more and more as we grow old and
are women, frozen by the fear of age&mdash;we come to rely on
the voice as the single outlet of the soul. Only thus, in
the curtailment of our means, can we relieve the straitened
cry of the passion within us; only thus, in the bitter and
sensitive shyness of advancing years, can we maintain relations
with those vivacious figures of the young that still
show before us and tend daily to become no more than the
moving wall-paper of life. Talk is the last link, the last
relation. But with the end of the conversation, when the
voice stops and the bright face of the listener is turned
away, solitude falls again on the bruised heart. Kirstie
had lost her &ldquo;cannie hour at e&rsquo;en&rdquo;; she could no more
wander with Archie, a ghost if you will, but a happy ghost,
in fields Elysian. And to her it was as if the whole world
had fallen silent; to him, but an unremarkable change of
amusements. And she raged to know it. The effervescency
of her passionate and irritable nature rose within
her at times to bursting point.</p>

<p>This is the price paid by age for unseasonable ardours
of feeling. It must have been so for Kirstie at any time
when the occasion chanced; but it so fell out that she
was deprived of this delight in the hour when she had
most need of it, when she had most to say, most to ask,
and when she trembled to recognise her sovereignty not
merely in abeyance but annulled. For, with the clairvoyance
of a genuine love, she had pierced the mystery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>
that had so long embarrassed Frank. She was conscious,
even before it was carried out, even on that Sunday night
when it began, of an invasion of her rights; and a voice
told her the invader&rsquo;s name. Since then, by arts, by
accident, by small things observed, and by the general
drift of Archie&rsquo;s humour, she had passed beyond all possibility
of doubt. With a sense of justice that Lord
Hermiston might have envied, she had that day in church
considered and admitted the attractions of the younger
Kirstie; and with the profound humanity and sentimentality
of her nature, she had recognised the coming of fate.
Not thus would she have chosen. She had seen, in imagination,
Archie wedded to some tall, powerful, and rosy
heroine of the golden locks, made in her own image, for
whom she would have strewed the bride-bed with delight;
and now she could have wept to see the ambition falsified.
But the gods had pronounced, and her doom was otherwise.</p>

<p>She lay tossing in bed that night, besieged with feverish
thoughts. There were dangerous matters pending, a
battle was toward, over the fate of which she hung in
jealousy, sympathy, fear, and alternate loyalty and disloyalty
to either side. Now she was reincarnated in her
niece, and now in Archie. Now she saw, through the girl&rsquo;s
eyes, the youth on his knees to her, heard his persuasive
instances with a deadly weakness, and received his overmastering
caresses. Anon, with a revulsion, her temper
raged to see such utmost favours of fortune and love
squandered on a brat of a girl, one of her own house, using
her own name&mdash;a deadly ingredient&mdash;and that &ldquo;didna
ken her ain mind an&rsquo; was as black&rsquo;s your hat.&rdquo; Now she
trembled lest her deity should plead in vain, loving the
idea of success for him like a triumph of nature; anon,
with returning loyalty to her own family and sex, she
trembled for Kirstie and the credit of the Elliotts. And
again she had a vision of herself, the day over for her old-world
tales and local gossip, bidding farewell to her last
link with life and brightness and love; and behind and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
beyond, she saw but the blank butt-end where she must
crawl to die. Had she then come to the lees? she, so
great, so beautiful, with a heart as fresh as a girl&rsquo;s and
strong as womanhood? It could not be, and yet it was so;
and for a moment her bed was horrible to her as the sides
of the grave. And she looked forward over a waste of hours,
and saw herself go on to rage, and tremble, and be softened,
and rage again, until the day came and the labours of the
day must be renewed.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard feet on the stairs&mdash;his feet, and
soon after the sound of a window-sash flung open. She
sat up with her heart beating. He had gone to his room
alone, and he had not gone to bed. She might again have
one of her night cracks; and at the entrancing prospect, a
change came over her mind; with the approach of this
hope of pleasure, all the baser metal became immediately
obliterated from her thoughts. She rose, all woman, and
all the best of woman, tender, pitiful, hating the wrong,
loyal to her own sex&mdash;and all the weakest of that dear miscellany,
nourishing, cherishing next her soft heart, voicelessly
flattering, hopes that she would have died sooner
than have acknowledged. She tore off her nightcap, and
her hair fell about her shoulders in profusion. Undying
coquetry awoke. By the faint light of her nocturnal rush,
she stood before the looking-glass, carried her shapely arms
above her head, and gathered up the treasures of her
tresses. She was never backward to admire herself; that
kind of modesty was a stranger to her nature; and she
paused, struck with a pleased wonder at the sight. &ldquo;Ye
daft auld wife!&rdquo; she said, answering a thought that was
not; and she blushed with the innocent consciousness of a
child. Hastily she did up the massive and shining coils,
hastily donned a wrapper, and with the rushlight in her
hand, stole into the hall. Below stairs she heard the
clock ticking the deliberate seconds, and Frank jingling
with the decanters in the dining-room. Aversion rose in
her, bitter and momentary. &ldquo;Nesty tippling puggy!&rdquo; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
thought; and the next moment she had knocked guardedly
at Archie&rsquo;s door and was bidden enter.</p>

<p>Archie had been looking out into the ancient blackness,
pierced here and there with a rayless star; taking the sweet
air of the moors and the night into his bosom deeply; seeking,
perhaps finding, peace after the manner of the unhappy.
He turned round as she came in, and showed her a pale face
against the window-frame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Kirstie?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unco late, my dear,&rdquo; said Kirstie, affecting unwillingness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;not at all. Come in, if you
want a crack. I am not sleepy, God knows!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She advanced, took a chair by the toilet-table and the
candle, and set the rushlight at her foot. Something&mdash;it
might be in the comparative disorder of her dress, it
might be the emotion that now welled in her bosom&mdash;had
touched her with a wand of transformation, and she seemed
young with the youth of goddesses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Erchie,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s this that&rsquo;s come to
ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not aware of anything that has come,&rdquo; said
Archie, and blushed, and repented bitterly that he had let
her in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, my dear, that&rsquo;ll no dae!&rdquo; said Kirstie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ill
to blend the eyes of love. O, Mr. Erchie, tak&rsquo; a thocht
ere it&rsquo;s ower late. Ye shouldna be impatient o&rsquo; the braws
o&rsquo; life, they&rsquo;ll a&rsquo; come in their saison, like the sun and the
rain. Ye&rsquo;re young yet; ye&rsquo;ve mony cantie years afore
ye. See and dinna wreck yersel&rsquo; at the outset like sae
mony ithers! Hae patience&mdash;they telled me aye that was
the owercome o&rsquo; life&mdash;hae patience, there&rsquo;s a braw day
coming yet. Gude kens it never cam&rsquo; to me; and here I
am, wi&rsquo; nayther man nor bairn to ca&rsquo; my ain, wearying a&rsquo;
folks wi&rsquo; my ill tongue, and you just the first, Mr. Erchie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a difficulty in knowing what you mean,&rdquo; said
Archie.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, and I&rsquo;ll tell ye,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this, that
I&rsquo;m feared. I&rsquo;m feared for ye, my dear. Remember,
your faither is a hard man, reaping where he hasna sowed
and gaithering where he hasna strawed. It&rsquo;s easy speakin&rsquo;,
but mind! Ye&rsquo;ll have to look in the gurley face o&rsquo;m,
where it&rsquo;s ill to look, and vain to look for mercy. Ye mind
me o&rsquo; a bonny ship pitten oot into the black and gowsty
seas&mdash;ye&rsquo;re a&rsquo; safe still, sittin&rsquo; quait and crackin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; Kirstie
in your lown chalmer; but whaur will ye be the morn,
and in whatten horror o&rsquo; the fearsome tempest, cryin&rsquo; on
the hills to cover ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Kirstie, you&rsquo;re very enigmatical to-night&mdash;and
very eloquent,&rdquo; Archie put in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, my dear Mr. Erchie,&rdquo; she continued, with a
change of voice, &ldquo;ye maunna think that I canna sympathise
wi&rsquo; ye. Ye maunna think that I havena been
young mysel&rsquo;. Lang syne, when I was a bit lassie, no
twenty yet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She paused and sighed. &ldquo;Clean and
caller, wi&rsquo; a fit like the hinney bee,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I
was aye big and buirdly, ye maun understand; a bonny
figure o&rsquo; a woman, though I say it that suldna&mdash;built to
rear bairns&mdash;braw bairns they suld hae been, and grand I
would hae likit it! But I was young, dear, wi&rsquo; the bonny
glint o&rsquo; youth in my e&rsquo;en, and little I dreamed I&rsquo;d ever be
tellin&rsquo; ye this, an auld, lanely, rudas wife! Weel, Mr.
Erchie, there was a lad cam&rsquo; courtin&rsquo; me, as was but
naetural. Mony had come before, and I would nane o&rsquo;
them. But this yin had a tongue to wile the birds frae the
lift and the bees frae the foxglove bells. Deary me, but
it&rsquo;s lang syne. Folk have dee&rsquo;d sinsyne and been buried,
and are forgotten, and bairns been born and got merrit
and got bairns o&rsquo; their ain. Sinsyne woods have been
plantit, and have grawn up and are bonny trees, and the
joes sit in their shadow; and sinsyne auld estates have
changed hands, and there have been wars and rumours of
wars on the face of the earth. And here I&rsquo;m still&mdash;like an
auld droopit craw&mdash;lookin&rsquo; on and craikin&rsquo;! But, Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span>
Erchie, do ye no think that I have mind o&rsquo; it a&rsquo; still? I
was dwalling then in my faither&rsquo;s house; and it&rsquo;s a curious
thing that we were whiles trysted in the Deil&rsquo;s Hags. And
do ye no think that I have mind of the bonny simmer days,
the lang miles o&rsquo; the bluid-red heather, the cryin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the
whaups, and the lad and the lassie that was trysted? Do
ye no think that I mind how the hilly sweetness ran about
my hairt? Ay, Mr. Erchie, I ken the way o&rsquo; it&mdash;fine do I
ken the way&mdash;how the grace o&rsquo; God takes them, like Paul
of Tarsus, when they think it least, and drives the pair o&rsquo;
them into a land which is like a dream, and the world and
the folks in &rsquo;t are nae mair than clouds to the puir lassie,
and heeven nae mair than windle-straes, if she can but
pleesure him! Until Tam dee&rsquo;d&mdash;that was my story,&rdquo;
she broke off to say, &ldquo;he dee&rsquo;d, and I wasna at the buryin&rsquo;.
But while he was here, I could take care o&rsquo; mysel&rsquo;. And
can yon puir lassie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kirstie, her eyes shining with unshed tears, stretched
out her hand towards him appealingly; the bright and
the dull gold of her hair flashed and smouldered in the coils
behind her comely head, like the rays of an eternal youth;
the pure colour had risen in her face; and Archie was
abashed alike by her beauty and her story. He came
towards her slowly from the window, took up her hand in
his and kissed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kirstie,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, &ldquo;you have misjudged me
sorely. I have always thought of her, I wouldna harm her
for the universe, my woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, lad, and that&rsquo;s easy sayin&rsquo;,&rdquo; cried Kirstie, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s nane sae easy doin&rsquo;! Man, do ye no comprehend that
it&rsquo;s God&rsquo;s wull we should be blendit and glamoured, and
have nae command over our ain members at a time like
that? My bairn,&rdquo; she cried, still holding his hand, &ldquo;think
o&rsquo; the puir lass! have pity upon her, Erchie! and O, be
wise for twa! Think o&rsquo; the risk she rins! I have seen ye,
and what&rsquo;s to prevent ithers? I saw ye once in the Hags,
in my ain howf, and I was wae to see ye there&mdash;in pairt for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
the omen, for I think there&rsquo;s a weird on the place&mdash;and in
pairt for pure nakit envy and bitterness o&rsquo; hairt. It&rsquo;s
strange ye should forgather there tae! God! but yon puir,
thrawn, auld Covenanter&rsquo;s seen a heap o&rsquo; human natur&rsquo;
since he lookit his last on the musket-barrels, if he never
saw nane afore,&rdquo; she added, with a kind of wonder in her
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear by my honour I have done her no wrong,&rdquo;
said Archie. &ldquo;I swear by my honour and the redemption
of my soul that there shall none be done her. I have
heard of this before. I have been foolish, Kirstie, but not
unkind, and, above all, not base.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my bairn!&rdquo; said Kirstie, rising. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll can
trust ye noo, I&rsquo;ll can gang to my bed wi&rsquo; an easy hairt.&rdquo;
And then she saw in a flash how barren had been her
triumph. Archie had promised to spare the girl, and he
would keep it; but who had promised to spare Archie?
What was to be the end of it? Over a maze of difficulties
she glanced, and saw, at the end of every passage, the flinty
countenance of Hermiston. And a kind of horror fell
upon her at what she had done. She wore a tragic mask.
&ldquo;Erchie, the Lord peety you dear, and peety me! I have
buildit on this foundation&rdquo;&mdash;laying her hand heavily on
his shoulder&mdash;&ldquo;and buildit hie, and pit my hairt in the
buildin&rsquo; of it. If the hale hypothec were to fa&rsquo;, I think,
laddie, I would dee! Excuse a daft wife that loves ye, and
that kenned your mither. And for His name&rsquo;s sake keep
yersel&rsquo; frae inordinate desires; hand your heart in baith
your hands, carry it canny and laigh; dinna send it up like
a bairn&rsquo;s kite into the collieshangie o&rsquo; the wunds! Mind,
Maister Erchie dear, that this life&rsquo;s a&rsquo; disappointment, and
a mouthfu&rsquo; o&rsquo; mools is the appointed end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, but Kirstie, my woman, you&rsquo;re asking me ower
much at last,&rdquo; said Archie, profoundly moved, and lapsing
into the broad Scots. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;re asking what nae man can
grant ye, what only the Lord of heaven can grant ye if He
see fit. Ay! And can even He? I can promise ye what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>277</span>
I shall do, and you can depend on that. But how I shall
feel&mdash;my woman, that is long past thinking of!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were both standing by now opposite each other.
The face of Archie wore the wretched semblance of a smile;
hers was convulsed for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Promise me ae thing,&rdquo; she cried, in a sharp voice.
&ldquo;Promise me ye&rsquo;ll never do naething without telling me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Kirstie, I canna promise ye that,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I
have promised enough, God kens!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May the blessing of God lift and rest upon ye, dear!&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless ye, my old friend,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h5>AT THE WEAVER&rsquo;S STONE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> was late in the afternoon when Archie drew near by the
hill path to the Praying Weaver&rsquo;s Stone. The Hags were
in shadow. But still, through the gate of the Slap, the sun
shot a last arrow, which sped far and straight across the
surface of the moss, here and there touching and shining
on a tussock, and lighted at length on the gravestone and
the small figure awaiting him there. The emptiness and
solitude of the great moors seemed to be concentred there,
and Kirstie pointed out by that finger of sunshine for the
only inhabitant. His first sight of her was thus excruciatingly
sad, like a glimpse of a world from which all light,
comfort, and society were on the point of vanishing. And
the next moment, when she had turned her face to him and
the quick smile had enlightened it, the whole face of nature
smiled upon him in her smile of welcome. Archie&rsquo;s slow
pace was quickened; his legs hasted to her though his heart
was hanging back. The girl, upon her side, drew herself
together slowly and stood up, expectant; she was all languor,
her face was gone white; her arms ached for him, her soul
was on tip-toes. But he deceived her, pausing a few steps
away, not less white than herself, and holding up his hand
with a gesture of denial.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Christina, not to-day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To-day I
have to talk to you seriously. Sit ye down, please, there
where you were. Please!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>

<p>The revulsion of feeling in Christina&rsquo;s heart was violent.
To have longed and waited these weary hours for him, rehearsing
her endearments&mdash;to have seen him at last come&mdash;to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span>
have been ready there, breathless, wholly passive, his
to do what he would with&mdash;and suddenly to have found
herself confronted with a grey-faced, harsh schoolmaster&mdash;it
was too rude a shock. She could have wept, but pride
withheld her. She sat down on the stone, from which she
had arisen, part with the instinct of obedience, part as
though she had been thrust there. What was this? Why
was she rejected? Had she ceased to please? She stood
here offering her wares, and he would none of them! And
yet they were all his! His to take and keep, not his to
refuse though! In her quick petulant nature, a moment
ago on fire with hope, thwarted love and wounded vanity
wrought. The schoolmaster that there is in all men, to the
despair of all girls and most women, was now completely in
possession of Archie. He had passed a night of sermons,
a day of reflection; he had come wound up to do his duty;
and the set mouth, which in him only betrayed the effort
of his will, to her seemed the expression of an averted heart.
It was the same with his constrained voice and embarrassed
utterance; and if so&mdash;if it was all over&mdash;the pang of the
thought took away from her the power of thinking.</p>

<p>He stood before her some way off. &ldquo;Kirstie, there&rsquo;s
been too much of this. We&rsquo;ve seen too much of each
other.&rdquo; She looked up quickly and her eyes contracted.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no good ever comes of these secret meetings.
They&rsquo;re not frank, not honest truly, and I ought to have
seen it. People have begun to talk; and it&rsquo;s not right of
me. Do you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see somebody will have been talking to ye,&rdquo; she said
sullenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have&mdash;more than one of them,&rdquo; replied
Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And whae were they?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And what kind
o&rsquo; love do ye ca&rsquo; that, that&rsquo;s ready to gang round like a
whirligig at folk talking? Do ye think they havena talked
to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they indeed?&rdquo; said Archie, with a quick breath.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
&ldquo;That is what I feared. Who were they? Who has
dare&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Archie was on the point of losing his temper.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, not any one had talked to Christina
on the matter; and she strenuously repeated her own first
question in a panic of self-defence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well! what does it matter?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They
were good folk that wished well to us, and the great affair
is that there are people talking. My dear girl, we have to
be wise. We must not wreck our lives at the outset. They
may be long and happy yet, and we must see to it, Kirstie,
like God&rsquo;s rational creatures and not like fool children.
There is one thing we must see to before all. You&rsquo;re worth
waiting for, Kirstie! worth waiting for a generation; it
would be enough reward.&rdquo;&mdash;And here he remembered the
schoolmaster again, and very unwisely took to following
wisdom. &ldquo;The first thing that we must see to is that
there shall be no scandal about for my father&rsquo;s sake. That
would ruin all; do ye no see that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kirstie was a little pleased, there had been some show of
warmth of sentiment in what Archie had said last. But
the dull irritation still persisted in her bosom; with the
aboriginal instinct, having suffered herself, she wished to
make Archie suffer.</p>

<p>And besides, there had come out the word she had
always feared to hear from his lips, the name of his father.
It is not to be supposed that, during so many days with a
love avowed between them, some reference had not been
made to their conjoint future. It had in fact been often
touched upon, and from the first had been the sore point.
Kirstie had wilfully closed the eye of thought; she would
not argue even with herself; gallant, desperate little heart,
she had accepted the command of that supreme attraction
like the call of fate, and marched blindfold on her doom.
But Archie, with his masculine sense of responsibility, must
reason; he must dwell on some future good, when the present
good was all in all to Kirstie; he must talk&mdash;and talk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
lamely, as necessity drove him&mdash;of what was to be. Again
and again he had touched on marriage; again and again
been driven back into indistinctness by a memory of Lord
Hermiston. And Kirstie had been swift to understand and
quick to choke down and smother the understanding; swift
to leap up in flame at a mention of that hope, which spoke
volumes to her vanity and her love, that she might one day
be Mrs. Weir of Hermiston; swift, also, to recognise in his
stumbling or throttled utterance the death-knell of these
expectations, and constant, poor girl! in her large-minded
madness, to go on and to reck nothing of the future. But
these unfinished references, these blinks in which his heart
spoke, and his memory and reason rose up to silence it
before the words were well uttered, gave her unqualifiable
agony. She was raised up and dashed down again bleeding.
The recurrence of the subject forced her, for however short
a time, to open her eyes on what she did not wish to see;
and it had invariably ended in another disappointment.
So now again, at the mere wind of its coming, at the mere
mention of his father&rsquo;s name&mdash;who might seem indeed to
have accompanied them in their whole moorland courtship,
an awful figure in a wig with an ironical and bitter smile,
present to guilty consciousness&mdash;she fled from it head
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye havena told me yet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who was it
spoke?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your aunt for one,&rdquo; said Archie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auntie Kirstie?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;And what do I care
for my Auntie Kirstie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She cares a great deal for her niece,&rdquo; replied Archie,
in kind reproof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Troth, and it&rsquo;s the first I&rsquo;ve heard of it,&rdquo; retorted
the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The question here is not who it is, but what they say,
what they have noticed,&rdquo; pursued the lucid schoolmaster.
&ldquo;That is what we have to think of in self-defence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auntie Kirstie, indeed! A bitter, thrawn auld maid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
that&rsquo;s fomented trouble in the country before I was born,
and will be doing it still, I daur say, when I&rsquo;m deid! It&rsquo;s
in her nature; it&rsquo;s as natural for her as it&rsquo;s for a sheep
to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Kirstie, she was not the only one,&rdquo; interposed
Archie. &ldquo;I had two warnings, two sermons, last
night, both most kind and considerate. Had you been
there, I promise you you would have grat, my dear! And
they opened my eyes. I saw we were going a wrong way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was the other one?&rdquo; Kirstie demanded.</p>

<p>By this time Archie was in the condition of a hunted
beast. He had come, braced and resolute; he was to trace
out a line of conduct for the pair of them in a few cold, convincing
sentences; he had now been there some time, and
he was still staggering round the outworks and undergoing
what he felt to be a savage cross-examination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Frank!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What nex&rsquo;, I would like
to ken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He spoke most kindly and truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What like did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not going to tell you; you have nothing to do
with that,&rdquo; cried Archie, startled to find he had admitted
so much.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I have naething to do with it!&rdquo; she repeated,
springing to her feet. &ldquo;A&rsquo;body at Hermiston&rsquo;s free to
pass their opinions upon me, but I have naething to do wi&rsquo;
it! Was this at prayers like? Did ye ca&rsquo; the grieve into
the consultation? Little wonder if a&rsquo;body&rsquo;s talking, when
ye make a&rsquo;body yer confidants! But as you say, Mr. Weir,
most kindly, most considerately, most truly, I&rsquo;m sure&mdash;I
have naething to do with it. And I think I&rsquo;ll better be
going. I&rsquo;ll be wishing you good evening, Mr. Weir.&rdquo; And
she made him a stately curtsey, shaking as she did so from
head to foot, with the barren ecstasy of temper.</p>

<p>Poor Archie stood dumbfounded. She had moved
some steps away from him before he recovered the gift of
articulate speech.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Kirstie!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;O, Kirstie woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was in his voice a ring of appeal, a clang of mere
astonishment that showed the schoolmaster was vanquished.</p>

<p>She turned round on him. &ldquo;What do ye Kirstie me
for?&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;What have ye to do wi&rsquo; me? Gang
to your ain freends and deave them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could only repeat the appealing &ldquo;Kirstie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kirstie, indeed!&rdquo; cried the girl, her eyes blazing in
her white face. &ldquo;My name is Miss Christina Elliott, I
would have ye to ken, and I daur ye to ca&rsquo; me out of it. If
I canna get love, I&rsquo;ll have respect, Mr. Weir. I&rsquo;m come
of decent people, and I&rsquo;ll have respect. What have I done
that ye should lightly me? What have I done? What
have I done? O, what have I done?&rdquo; and her voice rose
upon the third repetition. &ldquo;I thocht&mdash;I thocht&mdash;I thocht
I was sae happy!&rdquo; and the first sob broke from her like the
paroxysm of some mortal sickness.</p>

<p>Archie ran to her. He took the poor child in his arms,
and she nestled to his breast as to a mother&rsquo;s, and clasped
him in hands that were strong like vices. He felt her whole
body shaken by the throes of distress, and had pity upon
her beyond speech. Pity, and at the same time a bewildered
fear of this explosive engine in his arms, whose works he
did not understand, and yet had been tampering with.
There arose from before him the curtains of boyhood, and
he saw for the first time the ambiguous face of woman as
she is. In vain he looked back over the interview; he saw
not where he had offended. It seemed unprovoked, a
wilful convulsion of brute nature....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span></p>
<h2>SIR SIDNEY COLVIN&rsquo;S NOTE</h2>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">With</span> the words last printed, &ldquo;a wilful convulsion of brute
nature,&rdquo; the romance of &ldquo;Weir of Hermiston&rdquo; breaks off.
They were dictated, I believe, on the very morning of the
writer&rsquo;s sudden seizure and death. &ldquo;Weir of Hermiston&rdquo;
thus remains in the work of Stevenson what &ldquo;Edwin
Drood&rdquo; is in the work of Dickens or &ldquo;Denis Duval&rdquo; in
that of Thackeray: or rather it remains relatively more,
for if each of those fragments holds an honourable place
among its author&rsquo;s writings, among Stevenson&rsquo;s the fragment
of &ldquo;Weir&rdquo; holds, at least to my mind, certainly the
highest.</p>

<p>Readers may be divided in opinion on the question
whether they would or they would not wish to hear more
of the intended course of the story and destinies of the
characters. To some, silence may seem best, and that the
mind should be left to its own conjectures as to the sequel,
with the help of such indications as the text affords. I
confess that this is the view which has my sympathy. But
since others, and those almost certainly a majority, are
anxious to be told all they can, and since editors and
publishers join in the request, I can scarce do otherwise
than comply. The intended argument, then, so far as it
was known at the time of the writer&rsquo;s death to his step-daughter
and devoted amanuensis, Mrs. Strong, was nearly
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Archie persists in his good resolution of avoiding further
conduct compromising to young Kirstie&rsquo;s good name.
Taking advantage of the situation thus created, and of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
girl&rsquo;s unhappiness and wounded vanity, Frank Innes pursues
his purpose of seduction; and Kirstie, though still
caring for Archie in her heart, allows herself to become
Frank&rsquo;s victim. Old Kirstie is the first to perceive something
amiss with her, and believing Archie to be the culprit,
accuses him, thus making him aware for the first time that
mischief has happened. He does not at once deny the
charge, but seeks out and questions young Kirstie, who confesses
the truth to him; and he, still loving her, promises
to protect and defend her in her trouble. He then has an
interview with Frank Innes on the moor, which ends in a
quarrel, and in Archie killing Frank beside the Weaver&rsquo;s
Stone. Meanwhile the Four Black Brothers, having become
aware of their sister&rsquo;s betrayal, are bent on vengeance
against Archie as her supposed seducer. But their
vengeance is forestalled by his arrest for the murder of
Frank. He is tried before his own father, the Lord Justice-Clerk,
found guilty, and condemned to death. Meanwhile
the elder Kirstie, having discovered from the girl how
matters really stand, informs her nephews of the truth; and
they, in a great revulsion of feeling in Archie&rsquo;s favour,
determine on an action after the ancient manner of their
house. They gather a following, and after a great fight
break the prison where Archie lies confined, and rescue
him. He and young Kirstie thereafter escape to America.
But the ordeal of taking part in the trial of his own son has
been too much for the Lord Justice-Clerk, who dies of the
shock. &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; adds the amanuensis, &ldquo;what
becomes of old Kirstie, but that character grew and
strengthened so in the writing that I am sure he had some
dramatic destiny for her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plan of every imaginative work is subject, of course,
to change under the artist&rsquo;s hand as he carries it out; and
not merely the character of the elder Kirstie, but other
elements of the design no less, might well have deviated
from the lines originally traced. It seems certain, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
that the next stage in the relations of Archie and the
younger Kirstie would have been as above foreshadowed;
and this conception of the lover&rsquo;s unconventional chivalry
and unshaken devotion to his mistress after her fault is very
characteristic of the writer&rsquo;s mind. The vengeance to be
taken on the seducer beside the Weaver&rsquo;s Stone is prepared
for in the first words of the Introduction; and in the spring
of 1894 the author rehearsed in conversation with a visitor
(Mr. Sidney Lysaght) a scene where the girl was to confess
to her lover in prison that she was with child by the man
he had killed. The situation and fate of the judge, confronting
like a Brutus, but unable to survive, the duty of
sending his own son to the gallows, seem clearly to have
been destined to furnish the climax and essential tragedy of
the tale.</p>

<p>How this last circumstance was to have been brought
about, within the limits of legal usage and possibility, seems
hard to conjecture; but it was a point to which the author
had evidently given careful consideration. Mrs. Strong
says simply that the Lord Justice-Clerk, like an old Roman,
condemns his son to death; but I am assured on the best
legal authority of Scotland that no judge, however powerful
either by character or office, could have insisted on presiding
at the trial of a near kinsman of his own. The Lord Justice-Clerk
was head of the criminal justiciary of the country;
he might have insisted on his right of being present on the
bench when his son was tried; but he would never have
been allowed to preside or to pass sentence. Now in a letter
of Stevenson&rsquo;s to Mr. Baxter, of October 1892, I find him
asking for materials in terms which seem to indicate that
he knew this quite well:&mdash;&ldquo;I wish Pitcairn&rsquo;s &lsquo;Criminal
Trials,&rsquo; <i>quam primum</i>. Also an absolutely correct text of
the Scots judiciary oath. Also, in case Pitcairn does not
come down late enough, I wish as full a report as possible
of a Scots murder trial between 1790-1820. Understand,
<i>the fullest possible</i>. Is there any book which would guide
me to the following facts? The Justice-Clerk tries some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
people capitally on circuit. Certain evidence cropping up,
the charge is transferred to the Justice-Clerk&rsquo;s own son.
Of course in the next trial the Justice-Clerk is excluded,
and the case is called before the Lord Justice-General.
Where would this trial have to be? I fear in Edinburgh,
which would not suit my view. Could it be again at the
circuit town?&rdquo; The point was referred to a quondam
fellow-member with Stevenson of the Edinburgh Speculative
Society, Mr. Graham Murray, the present Lord
Advocate for Scotland, whose reply was to the effect that
there would be no difficulty in making the new trial take
place at the circuit town; that it would have to be held
there in spring or autumn, before two Lords of Justiciary;
and that the Lord Justice-General would have nothing to
do with it, this title being at the date in question only a
nominal one held by a layman (which is no longer the case).
On this Stevenson writes, &ldquo;Graham Murray&rsquo;s note <i>re</i> the
venue was highly satisfactory, and did me all the good in
the world.&rdquo; The terms of his inquiry imply clearly that he
intended other persons before Archie to have fallen under
suspicion of the murder (what other persons?); and also&mdash;doubtless
in order to make the rescue by the Black
Brothers possible&mdash;that he wanted Archie to be imprisoned
not in Edinburgh but in the circuit town. Can it have been
that Lord Hermiston&rsquo;s part was to have been limited to
presiding at the <i>first</i> trial, where the persons wrongly suspected
were to have been judged, and to directing that
the law should take its course when evidence incriminating
his own son was unexpectedly brought forward?</p>

<p>Whether the final escape and union of Archie and
Christina would have proved equally essential to the plot
may perhaps to most readers seem questionable. They
may rather feel that a tragic destiny is foreshadowed from
the beginning for all concerned, and is inherent in the very
conditions of the tale. But on this point, and other matters
of general criticism connected with it, I find an interesting
discussion by the author himself in his correspondence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
Writing to Mr. J. M. Barrie, under date November 1, 1892,
and criticising that author&rsquo;s famous story of &ldquo;The Little
Minister,&rdquo; Stevenson says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your descriptions of your dealings with Lord Rintoul
are frightfully unconscientious.... &lsquo;The Little Minister&rsquo;
ought to have ended badly; we all know it <i>did</i>, and we are
infinitely grateful to you for the grace and good feeling with
which you have lied about it. If you had told the truth, I
for one could never have forgiven you. As you had conceived
and written the earlier parts, the truth about the
end, though indisputably true to fact, would have been a
lie, or what is worse, a discord, in art. If you are going to
make a book end badly, it must end badly from the beginning.
Now, your book began to end well. You let yourself
fall in love with, and fondle, and smile at your puppets.
Once you had done that, your honour was committed: at
the cost of truth to life you were bound to save them. It
is the blot on &lsquo;Richard Feverel,&rsquo; for instance, that it begins
to end well; and then tricks you and ends ill. But in this
case, there is worse behind, for the ill ending does not inherently
issue from the plot&mdash;the story had, in fact, ended
well after the great last interview between Richard and
Lucy&mdash;and the blind, illogical bullet which smashes all has
no more to do between the boards than a fly has to do with
a room into whose open window it comes buzzing. It might
have so happened; it needed not; and unless needs must,
we have no right to pain our readers. I have had a heavy
case of conscience of the same kind about my Braxfield
story. Braxfield&mdash;only his name is Hermiston&mdash;has a son
who is condemned to death; plainly there is a fine tempting
fitness about this; and I meant he was to hang. But on
considering my minor characters, I saw there were five
people who would&mdash;in a sense, who must&mdash;break prison
and attempt his rescue. They are capable hardy folks
too, who might very well succeed. Why should they
not then? Why should not young Hermiston escape
clear out of the country? and be happy, if he could,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
with his&mdash;but soft! I will not betray my secret nor
my heroine....&rdquo;</p>

<p>To pass, now, from the question how the story would
have ended to the question how it originated and grew in
the writer&rsquo;s mind. The character of the hero, Weir of
Hermiston, is avowedly suggested by the historical personality
of Robert Macqueen, Lord Braxfield. This famous
judge has been for generations the subject of a hundred
Edinburgh tales and anecdotes. Readers of Stevenson&rsquo;s
essay on the Raeburn exhibition, in &ldquo;Virginibus Puerisque,&rdquo;
will remember how he is fascinated by Raeburn&rsquo;s portrait
of Braxfield, even as Lockhart had been fascinated by a
different portrait of the same worthy sixty years before
(see &ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s Letters to His Kinsfolk&rdquo;); nor did his interest
in the character diminish in later life.</p>

<p>Again, the case of a judge involved by the exigencies
of his office in a strong conflict between public duty and
private interest or affection, was one which had always
attracted and exercised Stevenson&rsquo;s imagination. In the
days when he and Mr. Henley were collaborating with a
view to the stage, Mr. Henley once proposed a plot founded
on the story of Mr. Justice Harbottle in Sheridan Le Fanu&rsquo;s
&ldquo;In a Glass Darkly,&rdquo; in which the wicked judge goes headlong
<i>per fas et nefas</i> to his object of getting the husband
of his mistress hanged. Some time later Stevenson and his
wife together drafted a play called <i>The Hanging Judge</i>. In
this, the title character is tempted for the first time in his
life to tamper with the course of justice, in order to shield
his wife from persecution by a former husband who reappears
after being supposed dead. Bulwer&rsquo;s novel of
&ldquo;Paul Clifford,&rdquo; with its final situation of the worldly-minded
judge, Sir William Brandon, learning that the highwayman
whom he is in the act of sentencing is his own son,
and dying of the knowledge, was also well known to Stevenson,
and probably counted for something in the suggestion
of the present story.</p>

<p>Once more, the difficulties often attending the relation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span>
of father and son in actual life had pressed heavily on
Stevenson&rsquo;s mind and conscience from the days of his youth,
when in obeying the law of his own nature he had been constrained
to disappoint, distress, and for a time to be much
misunderstood by, a father whom he justly loved and
admired with all his heart. Difficulties of this kind he had
already handled in a lighter vein once or twice in fiction&mdash;as
for instance in &ldquo;The Story of a Lie,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Misadventures
of John Nicholson,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Wrecker&rdquo;&mdash;before he
grappled with them in the acute and tragic phase in which
they occur in the present story.</p>

<p>These three elements, then, the interest of the historical
personality of Lord Braxfield, the problems and emotions
arising from a violent conflict between duty and nature in
a judge, and the difficulties due to incompatibility and misunderstanding
between father and son, lie at the foundations
of the present story. To touch on minor matters, it is
perhaps worth notice, as Mr. Henley reminds me, that the
name of Weir had from of old a special significance for
Stevenson&rsquo;s imagination, from the horrible and true tale of
the burning in Edinburgh of Major Weir, the warlock, and
his sister. Another name, that of the episodical personage
of Mr. Torrance the minister, is borrowed direct from life,
as indeed are the whole figure and its surroundings&mdash;kirkyard,
kirk, and manse&mdash;down even to the black thread
mittens: witness the following passage from a letter of the
early seventies:&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to church and am not depressed&mdash;a
great step. It was at that beautiful church&rdquo;
[of Glencorse in the Pentlands, three miles from his father&rsquo;s
country house at Swanston]. &ldquo;It is a little cruciform
place, with a steep slate roof. The small kirkyard is full
of old gravestones; one of a Frenchman from Dunkerque,
I suppose he died prisoner in the military prison hard by.
And one, the most pathetic memorial I ever saw: a poor
school-slate, in a wooden frame, with the inscription cut
into it evidently by the father&rsquo;s own hand. In church,
old Mr. Torrance preached, over eighty and a relic of times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
forgotten, with his black thread gloves and mild old face.&rdquo;
A side hint for a particular trait in the character of Mrs.
Weir we can trace in some family traditions concerning the
writer&rsquo;s own grandmother, who is reported to have valued
piety much more than efficiency in her domestic servants.
I know of no original for that new and admirable incarnation
of the eternal feminine in the elder Kirstie. The little
that Stevenson says about her himself is in a letter written
a few days before his death to Mr. Gosse. The allusions
are to the various views and attitudes of people in regard
to middle age, and are suggested by Mr. Gosse&rsquo;s volume of
poems, &ldquo;In Russet and Silver.&rdquo; &ldquo;It seems rather funny,&rdquo;
he writes, &ldquo;that this matter should come up just now, as
I am at present engaged in treating a severe case of middle
age in one of my stories, &lsquo;The Justice-Clerk.&rsquo; The case
is that of a woman, and I think I am doing her justice.
You will be interested, I believe, to see the difference in
our treatments. &lsquo;Secreta Vitae&rsquo; [the title of one of Mr.
Gosse&rsquo;s poems] comes nearer to the case of my poor Kirstie.&rdquo;
From the quality of the midnight scene between her and
Archie, we may judge what we have lost in those later scenes
where she was to have taxed him with the fault that was
not his&mdash;to have presently learned his innocence from the
lips of his supposed victim&mdash;to have then vindicated him
to her kinsmen and fired them to the action of his rescue.
The scene of the prison-breaking here planned by Stevenson
would have gained interest (as will already have occurred
to readers) from comparison with the two famous precedents
in Scott, the Porteous mob and the breaking of Portanferry
gaol.</p>

<p>The best account of Stevenson&rsquo;s methods of imaginative
work is in the following sentences from a letter of his own
to Mr. W. Craibe Angus of Glasgow:&mdash;&ldquo;I am still &lsquo;a slow
study,&rsquo; and sit for a long while silent on my eggs. Unconscious
thought, there is the only method: macerate your
subject, let it boil slow, then take the lid off and look in&mdash;and
there your stuff is&mdash;good or bad.&rdquo; The several elements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
above noted having been left to work for many years in
his mind, it was in the autumn of 1892 that he was moved
to &ldquo;take the lid off and look in,&rdquo;&mdash;under the influence, it
would seem, of a special and overmastering wave of that
feeling for the romance of Scottish scenery and character
which was at all times so strong in him, and which his exile
did so much to intensify. I quote again from his letter
to Mr. Barrie on November 1st in that year:&mdash;&ldquo;It is a
singular thing that I should live here in the South Seas
under conditions so new and so striking, and yet my imagination
so continually inhabit the cold old huddle of grey
hills from which we come. I have finished &lsquo;David Balfour,&rsquo;
I have another book on the stocks, &lsquo;The Young Chevalier,&rsquo;
which is to be part in France and part in Scotland, and
to deal with Prince Charlie about the year 1749; and now
what have I done but begun a third, which is to be all moorland
together, and is to have for a centre-piece a figure that
I think you will appreciate&mdash;that of the immortal Braxfield.
Braxfield himself is my grand premier&mdash;or since you are so
much involved in the British drama, let me say my heavy
lead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Writing to me at the same date he makes the same
announcement more briefly, with a list of the characters
and an indication of the scene and date of the story. To
Mr. Baxter he writes a month later, &ldquo;I have a novel on the
stocks to be called &lsquo;The Justice-Clerk.&rsquo; It is pretty Scotch;
the grand premier is taken from Braxfield (O, by the by,
send me Cockburn&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memorials&rsquo;), and some of the story
is, well, queer. The heroine is seduced by one man, and
finally disappears with the other man who shot him....
Mind you, I expect &lsquo;The Justice-Clerk&rsquo; to be my masterpiece.
My Braxfield is already a thing of beauty and a joy
for ever, and so far as he has gone far my best character.&rdquo;
From the last extract it appears that he had already at this
date drafted some of the earlier chapters of the book. He
also about the same time composed the dedication to his
wife, who found it pinned to her bed-curtains one morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
on awaking. It was always his habit to keep several books
in progress at the same time, turning from one to another
as the fancy took him, and finding relief in the change of
labour; and for many months after the date of this letter,
first illness,&mdash;then a voyage to Auckland,&mdash;then work on
&ldquo;The Ebb-Tide,&rdquo; on a new tale called &ldquo;St. Ives,&rdquo; which was
begun during an attack of influenza, and on his projected
book of family history,&mdash;prevented his making any continuous
progress with &ldquo;Weir.&rdquo; In August 1893 he says he
has been recasting the beginning. A year later, still only
the first four or five chapters had been drafted. Then, in
the last weeks of his life, he attacked the task again, in a
sudden heat of inspiration, and worked at it ardently and
without interruption until the end came. No wonder if
during these weeks he was sometimes aware of a tension
of the spirit difficult to sustain. &ldquo;How can I keep this
pitch?&rdquo; he is reported to have said after finishing one of the
chapters; and all the world knows how that frail organism,
overtaxed so long, in fact betrayed him in mid effort.</p>

<p>With reference to the speech and manners of the Hanging
Judge himself: that they are not a whit exaggerated, in
comparison with what is recorded of his historic prototype,
Lord Braxfield, is certain. The <i>locus classicus</i> in regard to
this personage is in Lord Cockburn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memorials of his
Time.&rdquo; &ldquo;Strong built and dark, with rough eyebrows,
powerful eyes, threatening lips, and a low growling voice,
he was like a formidable blacksmith. His accent and dialect
were exaggerated Scotch; his language, like his thoughts,
short, strong, and conclusive. Illiterate and without any
taste for any refined enjoyment, strength of understanding,
which gave him power without cultivation, only encouraged
him to a more contemptuous disdain of all natures less
coarse than his own. It may be doubted if he was ever so
much in his element as when tauntingly repelling the last
despairing claim of a wretched culprit, and sending him to
Botany Bay or the gallows with an insulting jest. Yet this
was not from cruelty, for which he was too strong and too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>294</span>
jovial, but from cherished coarseness.&rdquo; Readers, nevertheless,
who are at all acquainted with the social history of
Scotland will hardly have failed to make the observation
that Braxfield&rsquo;s is an extreme case of eighteenth-century
manners, as he himself was an eighteenth-century personage
(he died in 1799, in his seventy-eighth year); and that for
the date in which the story is cast (1814) such manners are
somewhat of an anachronism. During the generation contemporary
with the French Revolution and the Napoleonic
wars&mdash;or, to put it another way, the generation that elapsed
between the days when Scott roamed the country as a
High School and University student and those when he
settled in the fulness of fame and prosperity at Abbotsford,&mdash;or
again (the allusions will appeal to readers of the admirable
Galt) during the interval between the first and the last
provostry of Bailie Pawkie in the borough of Gudetown,
or between the earlier and final ministrations of Mr. Balwhidder
in the parish of Dalmailing,&mdash;during this period
a great softening had taken place in Scottish manners generally,
and in those of the Bar and Bench not least. &ldquo;Since
the death of Lord Justice-Clerk Macqueen of Braxfield,&rdquo;
says Lockhart, writing about 1817, &ldquo;the whole exterior
of judicial deportment has been quite altered.&rdquo; A similar
criticism may probably hold good on the picture of border
life contained in the chapter concerning the Four Black
Brothers of Cauldstaneslap, namely, that it rather suggests
the ways of an earlier generation; nor have I any clue to
the reasons which led Stevenson to choose this particular
date, in the year preceding Waterloo, for a story which,
in regard to some of its features at least, might seem more
naturally placed some quarter or even half a century earlier.</p>

<p>If the reader seeks, further, to know whether the scenery
of Hermiston can be identified with any one special place
familiar to the writer&rsquo;s early experience, the answer, I think,
must be in the negative. Rather it is distilled from a
number of different haunts and associations among the
moorlands of southern Scotland. In the dedication and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span>
in a letter to me he indicates the Lammermuirs as the scene
of his tragedy. And Mrs. Stevenson (his mother) told me
that she thought he was inspired by recollections of a visit
paid in boyhood to an uncle living at a remote farmhouse
in that district called Overshiels, in the parish of Stow.
But though he may have thought of the Lammermuirs in
the first instance, we have already found him drawing his
description of the kirk and manse from another haunt of his
youth, namely, Glencorse in the Pentlands; while passages
in chapters v. and viii. point explicitly to a third district,
that is, Upper Tweeddale, with the country stretching thence
towards the wells of Clyde. With this country also holiday
rides and excursions from Peebles had made him familiar as
a boy: and on the whole it is this which best answers the
geographical indications of the story. Some of the place-names
are clearly not meant to furnish literal indications.
The Spango, for instance, is a water running, I believe, not
into the Tweed but into the Nith. Crossmichael as the
name of a town is borrowed from Galloway; but it may be
taken to all intents and purposes as standing for Peebles,
where I am told by Sir George Douglas there existed in the
early years of the century a well-known club of the same
character as that described in the story. Lastly, the name
Hermiston itself is taken from a farm on the Water of Ale,
between Ettrick and Teviotdale, and close to the proper
country of the Elliotts.</p>

<p>But it is with the general and essential that the artist
deals, and questions of strict historical perspective or local
definition are beside the mark in considering his work.
Nor will any reader expect, or be grateful for, comment in
this place on matters which are more properly to the point&mdash;on
the seizing and penetrating power of the author&rsquo;s
ripened art as exhibited in the foregoing pages, his vital
poetry of vision and magic of presentment. Surely no son
of Scotland has died leaving with his last breath a worthier
tribute to the land he loved.</p>
